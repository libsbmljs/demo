We by using mathematical modeling of cell division cycle a potential mechanism for precisely controlling the frequency of cell division and regulating the size of a dividing cell. Control of the cell cycle is achieved by artificially expressing a protein that reversibly binds and inactivates any one of the CDC proteins. In the simplest such as the checkpoint-free situation encountered in early amphibian the frequency of CDC oscillations can be increased or decreased by regulating the rate of binding or the equilibrium constant of the binding protein. In a more complex model of cell where size-control checkpoints are we show that the same reversible binding reaction can alter the mean cell mass in a continuously dividing cell. Because this control scheme is general and requires only the expression of a single it provides a practical means for tuning the characteristics of cell cycle in vivo.

It is observed from the model that there is an increase in sensitivity along the levels of where the activity of MAPK reaches its maximal before MAPKKK. This model is described in the Ultrasensitivity mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Huang Ferrell JE Jr Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. The mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is a highly conserved series of three protein kinases implicated in diverse biological processes. Here we demonstrate that the cascade arrangement has unexpected consequences for the dynamics of MAPK signaling. We solved the rate equations for the cascade numerically and found that MAPK is predicted to behave like a highly cooperative even though it was not assumed that any of the enzymes in cascade were regulated cooperatively. Measurements of MAPK activation in Xenopus oocyte extracts confirmed this prediction. The curve of the MAPK was found to be as steep that of a cooperative enzyme with a Hill coefficient of well in excess of that the classical allosteric protein hemoglobin. The shape of the MAPK response curve may make the cascade particularly appropriate for mediating processes like cell fate and oocyte where a cell switches from one discrete state to another. The species KKK_P_norm and KK_PP_norm are the relative concentrations of the active MAPKK and that is the or single resp. phophorylated forms divided by the total concentrations of each kinase. For MAPK additionally the also active MAPK divided by the maximal concentration of active MAPK is given by rel_K_PP_max.

This model is described in the Negative feedback and ultrasensitivity can bring about oscillations in the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. Kholodenko BN Eur. J. Biochem. Functional organization of signal transduction into protein phosphorylation such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase greatly enhances the sensitivity of cellular targets to external stimuli. The sensitivity increases multiplicatively with the number of cascade so that a tiny change in a stimulus results in a large change in the phenomenon referred to as ultrasensitivity. In a variety of cell the MAPK cascades are imbedded in long feedback positive or depending on whether the terminal kinase stimulates or inhibits the activation of initial level. Here we demonstrate that a negative feedback loop combined with intrinsic ultrasensitivity of the MAPK cascade can bring about sustained oscillations in MAPK phosphorylation. Based on recent kinetic data on the MAPK we predict that the period of oscillations can range from minutes to hours. The phosphorylation level can vary between the base level and almost of the total protein. The oscillations of the phosphorylation cascades and slow protein diffusion in the cytoplasm can lead to intracellular waves of phospho-proteins.

This model is described in the Mathematical models of purine metabolism in man. Curto Voit Sorribas Cascante M. Math Biosci Experimental and clinical data on purine metabolism are collated and analyzed with three mathematical models. The first model is the result of an attempt to construct a traditional kinetic model based on Michaelis-Menten rate laws. This attempt is only partially since kinetic while is not and since qualitative information is difficult to incorporate into this type of model. The data gaps necessitate the complementation of Michaelis-Menten model with other functional forms that can incorporate different types of data. The most convenient and established representations for this purpose are rate laws formulated as power-law and these are used to construct a Complemented Michaelis-Menten model. The other two models are pure one in the form of a Generalized Mass Action and the other one in the form of an S-system. The first part of the paper contains a compendium of experimental data necessary for any model of purine metabolism. This is followed by the formulation of three models and a comparative analysis. For physiological and moderately pathological perturbations in metabolites or the results of three models are very similar and consistent with clinical findings. This is an encouraging result since the three models have different structures and data requirements are based on different mathematical assumptions. Significant enzyme deficiencies are not so well modeled by the S-system model.

In the more traditional genetic engineering approaches are pinpointed using intuitive but the alleviation of suspected steps has not often been successful. Here the authors demonstrate that a model of pyruvate distribution in Lactococcus lactis based on enzyme kinetics in combination with metabolic control analysis clearly indicates the key control points in the flux to acetoin and important flavour compounds. The model presented here at showed that the enzymes with greatest effect on this flux resided outside the acetolactate synthase branch itself.

This model is described in the Folate cycle kinetics in human breast cancer cells. Morrison Allegra CJ. J. Biol. Chem. A mathematical description of polyglutamated folate kinetics for human breast carcinoma cells has been formulated based upon experimental methotrexate and pyrimidine pool sizes as well reaction rate parameters obtained from intact MCF-7 cells and their enzyme isolates. The schema accounts for the interconversion of highly polyglutamated dihydrofolate 10-formyl-FH4 and 10-formyl-FH2 as well formation and transport of the MTX polyglutamates. Inhibition mechanisms have been chosen to reproduce all observed and pure competition inhibition patterns. Steady state folate concentrations and thymidylate purine synthesis rates in drug-free intact cells were used to determine normal folate Vmax values. The resulting average-cell folate examined for its ability to predict folate pool behavior following exposure to microM MTX over agreed well with the including a relative preservation of the FFH4 and CH2FH4 pools. The results depend strongly on thymidylate synthase reaction especially the assumption that MTX di- and triglutamates inhibit TS synthesis as greatly in the intact cell as they do with purified enzyme. The effects of cell cycle dependence of TS and dihydrofolate reductase activities were also examined by introducing G- to S-phase activity ratios of these enzymes into the model. For activity ratios down to at least cell population averaged folate pools were only slightly while CH2FH4 pools in S-phase cells were reduced to as little of control values. these folate pool dynamics were indicated to arise from both direct inhibition by MTX polyglutamates as well inhibition by elevated levels of polyglutamated FH2 and FFH2. two flow BCs were converted into two downstream concentration thus removing the GAR and dUMP state variables.

We present a computational model that offers an integrated and topological representation of intracellular signal based on known components of epidermal growth factor receptor signal pathways.

We use methods of statistical mechanics to extract useful predictions for complex cellular signaling networks. A key difficulty with signaling models is while significant effort is being made to experimentally measure the rate constants for individual steps in these many of the parameters required to describe their behavior remain unknown or at best represent estimates. To establish the usefulness of our we have applied our methods toward modeling the nerve growth factor differentiation of neuronal cells. In we study the actions of NGF and mitogenic epidermal growth factor in rat pheochromocytoma cells. Through a network of intermediate signaling each of these growth factors stimulates extracellular regulated kinase phosphorylation with distinct dynamical profiles. Using our modeling we are able to predict the influence of specific signaling modules in determining the integrated cellular response to the two growth factors. Our methods also raise some interesting insights into the design and possible evolution of cellular highlighting an inherent property of these systems that we call The figures in the paper show results from computations performed over an ensemble of all parameter sets that fit the available data.

G. M. van Beek Available from Nature Precedings There has been much debate on the mechanism of regulation mitochondrial ATP synthesis to balance ATP consumption during changing cardiac workloads. A key role of creatine kinase isoenzymes in this regulation of oxidative phosphorylation and in intracellular energy transport had been but has in the mean time been disputed for many years. It was hypothesized that high-energy phosphorylgroups are obligatorily transferred via this is termed the phosphocreatine shuttle. The other important role ascribed to the CK system is its ability to buffer ADP concentration in cytosol near sites of ATP hydrolysis. Almost all of the experiments to determine the role of CK had been done in the steady but recently the dynamic response of oxidative phosphorylation to quick changes in cytosolic ATP hydrolysis has been assessed at various levels of inhibition CK. Steady state models of CK function in energy transfer existed but were unable to explain the dynamic response with CK inhibited. The aim of this study was to explain the mode of functioning the CK system in and particular the role of different CK isoenzymes in the dynamic response to workload steps. For this purpose we used a mathematical model of cardiac muscle cell energy metabolism containing the kinetics of key processes energy consumption and transfer pathways. The model underscores that CK plays indeed a dual role in the cardiac cells. The buffering role of CK system is due to the activity of myofibrillar CK while the energy transfer role depends on the activity of mitochondrial CK We propose that this may lead to the differences in regulation mechanisms and energy transfer modes in species with relatively low MiCK activity such as rabbit in comparison with species high MiCK activity such as rat. The model needed modification to explain the new type of experimental data on the dynamic response of the mitochondria. We submit that building a Virtual Muscle Cell is not possible without continuous experimental tests to improve the model. In close interaction with experiments we are developing a model for muscle energy metabolism and transport mediated by the creatine kinase isoforms which now already can explain many different types of experiments.

Web-based modelling using JWS Online This model is described in the Quantification of short term signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor. Kholodenko Demin Moehren Hoek JB J. Biol. Chem. During the past our knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in growth factor signaling has proliferated almost explosively. the kinetics and control of information transfer through signaling networks remain poorly understood. This paper combines experimental kinetic analysis and computational modeling of the short term pattern of cellular responses to epidermal growth factor in isolated hepatocytes. The experimental data show transient tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and transient or sustained response patterns in multiple signaling proteins targeted by EGFR. Transient responses exhibit pronounced reached within s of EGF stimulation and followed by a decline to relatively low levels. In contrast to earlier we demonstrate that the experimentally observed transients can be accounted for without requiring receptor-mediated activation of specific tyrosine following EGF stimulation. The kinetic model predicts how the cellular response is controlled by the relative levels and activity states of signaling proteins and under what conditions activation patterns are transient or sustained. EGFR signaling patterns appear to be robust with respect to variations in many elemental rate constants within the range of experimentally measured values. On the other we specify which changes in the kinetic rate and total amounts of molecular factors involved are incompatible with the experimentally observed kinetics of signal transfer. Quantitation of signaling network responses to growth factors allows us to assess how cells process information controlling their growth and differentiation.

The determinant criterion was used as the statistical fit criterion. Model discrimination was performed by both chemical insight and statistical tests Probability and Akaike Kinetic analysis showed that at lower pH DFG is favoured whereas with increasing pH becomes a more relevant degradation pathway. The lower amount observed of 1-DG is related with its high reactivity. It was shown that acetic a main degradation product from was mainly formed through 1-DG degradation. Also from the estimated parameters 3-DG was found to be the main precursor in carbohydrate fragments responsible for colour formation.

Page The adaptive responses of a living cell to internal and external signals are controlled by networks of proteins whose interactions are so complex that the functional integration of the network cannot be comprehended by intuitive reasoning alone. Mathematical based on biochemical rate provides a rigorous and reliable tool for unraveling the complexities of molecular regulatory networks. The budding yeast cell cycle is a challenging test case for this because the control system is known in exquisite detail and its function is constrained by the phenotypic properties of genetically engineered strains. We show that a mathematical model built on a consensus picture of this control system is largely successful in explaining the phenotypes of mutants described so far. A few inconsistencies between the model and experiments indicate aspects of the mechanism that require revision. In the model allows one to frame and critique hypotheses about how the division cycle is regulated in wild-type and mutant to predict the phenotypes of new mutant and to estimate the effective values of biochemical rate constants that are difficult to measure directly in vivo.

These data show the validity in vivo of kinetic models previously proposed for phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase based on in vitro studies. Kinetic representations of glycogen and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate which incorporate major regulatory properties of these are all consistent with the in vivo data. This detailed model of pathway kinetics and these data on intracellular metabolite concentrations allow evaluation of flux-control coefficients for all key enzymes involved in glucose catabolism under the four different cell environments examined.

The final model consists of five nonlinear differential delay equations with delays due to the transcription and translation process.

We have tested our model against two sets of beta-galactosidase activity versus time as well a set of data on beta-galactosidase activity during periodic phosphate feeding. In all three cases we find excellent agreement between the data and model predictions.

Curien Ravanel Dumas R Eur. J. Biochem. This work proposes a model of the metabolic branch-point between the methionine and threonine biosynthesis pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana which involves kinetic competition for phosphohomoserine between the allosteric enzyme threonine synthase and the two-substrate enzyme cystathionine gamma-synthase. Threonine synthase is activated by S-adenosylmethionine and inhibited by AMP. Cystathionine gamma-synthase condenses phosphohomoserine to cysteine via a ping-pong mechanism. Reactions are irreversible and inhibited by inorganic phosphate. The modelling procedure included an examination of the kinetic determination of the operating conditions in chloroplasts and the establishment of a computer model using the enzyme rate equations. To test the branch-point was reconstituted with purified enzymes. The computer model showed a partial agreement with the in vitro results. The model was subsequently improved and was then found consistent with flux partition in vitro and vivo. Under near physiological but not modulates the partition of a steady-state flux of phosphohomoserine. The computer model indicates a high sensitivity of cystathionine flux to enzyme and S-adenosylmethionine concentrations. Cystathionine flux is sensitive to modulation of threonine flux whereas the reverse is not true. The cystathionine gamma-synthase kinetic mechanism favours a low sensitivity of the fluxes to cysteine. Though sensitivity to inorganic phosphate is its concentration conditions the dynamics of system. Threonine synthase and cystathionine gamma-synthase display similar kinetic efficiencies in the metabolic context considered and are first-order for the phosphohomoserine substrate. Under these conditions outflows are coordinated.

Our computational model of the circadian clock comprised the feedback loop between LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION and a interlocking feedback loop involving TOC1 and a hypothetical component Y. Experiments based on model predictions suggested GIGANTEA as a candidate for Y. We now extend the model to include a recently demonstrated feedback loop between the TOC1 homologues PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR PRR9 and LHY CCA1. This three-loop network explains the rhythmic phenotype of toc1 mutant alleles. Model predictions fit closely to new data on the which confirm that GI is a major contributor to Y function. Analysis of the three-loop network suggests that the plant clock consists of morning and evening coupled which may be analogous to morning and evening clock cells in Drosophila and the mouse.

It is based on the assumption that feedback inhibition of cysteine on the sulfate transporters leads to oscillations in this pathway and causes oscillations in respiratory activity via inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase by hydrogen disulfide. The model is and reproduces the respiratory oscillation pattern quite well. It is based on very coarse-grained representations of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle and the mitochondrial electron transport chain The sulfate assimilatory pathways also contains some significant simplifcations. The model corresponds to Fig. 2B of the with a slight phase shift of the oscillations. No initial conditions were given in the and thus they were chosen arbitrarily in a range that lies within the basin of attraction the limit cycle oscillations.

Cytosolic mass conservation The model uses mass conservation for cytosolic adenosine nucleotides with is however not encoded in the but is implied by the lumped reaction v4. This combines the enzymatic reactions of phosphoadenylyl-sulfate reductase protein EC and sulfite reductase Met5p and EC also has not to confuse with ID pap in this standing for as a product. PAP is the substrate for enzyme nucleotidase which would revover AMP Then can be assumed to equilibrated with ATP and ADP via adenylate as often used in metabolic models. This AMP production is implied in the mass conservation for cytosolic adenosine phosphates. Accounting for these reactions explicitly does not change the dynamics of model significantly. An according version can be obtained from the SBML creator Redox The enzyme sulfite reductase Met5p and EC part of reaction actually uses and the authors assume equilibration of NADH and NADPH. But actually S. cerevisiae specifically is missing the according enzyme transhydrogenase or EC also oxidizes thioredoxin and would actually require an additional NADPH for thioredoxin recovery This would slightly affect the redox balance of the model.

Many molecular chaperones are also known as heat shock proteins because they are synthesised in increased amounts after brief exposure of cells to elevated temperatures. They have many cellular functions and are involved in the folding of nascent the re-folding of denatured the prevention of protein and assisting the targeting of proteins for degradation by the proteasome and lysosomes. They also have a role in apoptosis and are involved in modulating signals for immune and inflammatory responses. Stress-induced transcription of heat shock proteins requires the activation of heat shock factor Under normal HSF is bound to heat shock proteins resulting in feedback repression. During cellular proteins undergo denaturation and sequester heat shock proteins bound to which is then able to become transcriptionally active. The induction of heat shock proteins is impaired with age and there is also a decline in chaperone function. proteins accumulate with age and are implicated in several important age-related conditions and the balance between damaged proteins and available free chaperones may be greatly disturbed during ageing.

It uses a simple unbranched pathway and a constraint of fixed total enzyme. It calculates enzyme profiles at different times which optimise a performance and compares them to experimental data. The initial model is cell-type while the experimeental data is from yeast. This model is described in the Prediction of temporal gene expression. Metabolic opimization by re-distribution of enzyme activities. Klipp Heinrich Holzhütter HG. Eur. J. Biochem. A computational approach is used to analyse temporal gene expression in the context of metabolic regulation. It is based on the assumption that cells developed optimal adaptation strategies to changing environmental conditions. Time- dependent enzyme profiles are calculated which optimize the function of a metabolic pathway under the constraint of limited total enzyme amount. For linear model pathways it is shown that wave-like enzyme profiles are optimal for a rapid substrate turnover. For the central metabolism of yeast cells enzyme profiles are calculated which ensure long-term homeostasis of key metabolites under conditions of a diauxic shift. These enzyme profiles are in close correlation with observed gene expression data. Our results demonstrate that optimality principles help to rationalize observed gene expression profiles. This model is from the paper Prediction of temporal gene expression metabolic optimization by re-distribution of enzyme activities.

It is assumed that these proteins are only degraded after they have lost their native structure due to a damage event. This is represented in the model by misfolding reaction which depends on the level of reactive oxygen species in the cell. Misfolded proteins are first bound by an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitin is activated by E1 and then passed to E2 The enzyme then passes the ubiquitin molecule to the complex with net effect that the misfolded protein is monoubiquitinated and both E2 E3 are released. Further ubiquitin molecules are added in a step-wise manner. When the chain of ubiquitin molecules is of length or the polyubiquitinated misfolded protein may bind to the proteasome. The model also includes de-ubiquitinating enzymes which cleave ubiquitin molecules from the chain in a step-wise manner. They work on chains attached to misfolded proteins both unbound and bound to the proteasomes. Misfolded proteins bound to the proteasome may be degraded releasing ubiquitin. Misfolded proteins including ubiquitinated may also aggregate. Aggregates may be sequestered which takes them out of way or they may bind to the proteasome Proteasomes bound by aggregates are no longer available for protein degradation. Figure and has been simulated using Gillespie2. This model is described in the An silico model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that incorporates normal homeostasis and age-related decline. Proctor Tsirigotis Gray DA. BMC Syst Biol The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language Simulations are carried out on the BASIS of Ageing e-Science Integration and system the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics. We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin models the inclusion of a pool short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process.

Please note that active MPF and cyclin concentrations in the paper are given relative to total cdc2 concentration Active MPF is the cyclin-cdc2 complex that is phosphorylated at Thr161. The earlier versions of the model was successfully tested on MathSBML and the current version was checked in Copasi. This model is described in the Numerical analysis of a comprehensive model of M-phase control in Xenopus oocyte extracts and intact embryos. Novak Tyson JJ. J. Cell. Sci. Pt To contribute to a deeper understanding of M-phase control in eukaryotic we have constructed a model based on the biochemistry of M-phase promoting factor in Xenopus oocyte where there is evidence for two positive feedback loops stimulates its own production by activating Cdc25 and inhibiting a negative feedback loop stimulates its own destruction by indirectly activating the ubiquitin pathway that degrades its cyclin To uncover the full dynamical possibilities of the control we translate the regulatory network into a set of differential equations and study these equations by graphical techniques and computer simulation. The positive feedback loops in the model account for thresholds and time lags in cyclin-induced and MPF-induced activation of and the model can be fitted quantitatively to these experimental observations. The negative feedback loop is consistent with observed time lags in MPF-induced cyclin degradation. our model indicates that there are two possible mechanisms for autonomous oscillations. One is driven by the positive feedback resulting in phosphorylation and abrupt dephosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit at an inhibitory tyrosine residue. These oscillations are typical of oocyte extracts. The other type is driven by the negative feedback involving rapid cyclin turnover and negligible phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of Cdc2. The early mitotic cycles of intact embryos exhibit such characteristics. In by assuming that unreplicated DNA interferes with M-phase initiation by activating the phosphatases that oppose MPF in the positive feedback we can simulate the effect of addition sperm nuclei to oocyte and the lengthening of cycle times at the mid-blastula transition of intact embryos.

Olsen Kummer Kindzelskii Petty HR. Biophys. J. We present a two-compartment model to explain the oscillatory behavior observed experimentally in activated neutrophils. Our model is based mainly on the peroxidase-oxidase reaction catalyzed by myeloperoxidase with melatonin as a cofactor and NADPH a major protein in the phagosome membrane of the leukocyte. The model predicts that after activation of a an increase in the activity of hexose monophosphate shunt and the delivery of myeloperoxidase into the phagosome results in oscillations oxygen and concentration. The period of oscillation changes from s to s. The model is consistent with previously reported oscillations in cell metabolism and oxidant production. Key features and predictions of the model were confirmed experimentally. The requirement of the hexose monophosphate pathway for s oscillations was verified using 6-aminonicotinamide and which are inhibitors of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The role of the NADPH oxidase in promoting oscillations was confirmed by dose-response studies of the effect diphenylene an inhibitor of the NADPH oxidase. model predicted an increase in the amplitude of NADPH oscillations in the presence of which was confirmed experimentally.

This model is described in the A quantitative kinetic model for ATP-induced intracellular oscillations. Wang Huang W. J. Theor. Biol. A quantitative kinetic model is proposed to simulate the ATP-induced intracellular oscillations. The quantitative effect of ATP concentration upon the oscillations was successfully simulated. Our simulation results support previous experimental explanations that the oscillations are mainly due to interaction of release from the endoplasmic reticulum and the ATP-dependent pump back into the and oscillations are prolonged by extracellular entry that maintains the constant supplies to its intracellular stores. The model is also able to simulate the sudden disappearance phenomenon of the oscillations observed in some cell types by taking into account of the biphasic characteristic of the release from endoplasmic reticulum the model simulation results for the oscillations characteristics such as peak and average lead to prediction of some possible factors responsible for the variations of oscillations in different types of cells.

Komarova Smith Dixon Sims Wahl LM Bone2003 Bone remodeling occurs asynchronously at multiple sites in the adult skeleton and involves resorption by followed formation of new bone by osteoblasts. Disruptions in bone remodeling contribute to the pathogenesis of disorderssuch as and disease. Interactions among cells of osteoblast and osteoclast lineages are critical in the regulation of bone remodeling. We constructed a mathematical model of autocrine and paracrine interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts that allowed us to calculate cell population dynamics and changes in bone mass at a discrete site of bone remodeling. Themodel predicted different modes of dynamic a single remodeling cycle in response to an external a series of internally regulated cycles of bone or unstable behavior similar to pathological bone remodeling in disease. Parametric analysis demonstrated that the mode of dynamic behaviorin the system depends strongly on the regulation of osteoclasts by autocrine such as transforming growth factor beta. simulations demonstratedthat nonlinear dynamics of the system may explain the differing effects of immunosuppressants on bone remodeling in vitro and vivo. In the mathematical model revealed that interactions among osteoblasts and osteoclasts result in nonlinear system which cannot be deduced from studies of each cell type alone. The model will be useful in future studies assessing the impact of growth and potential therapies on the overall process ofremodeling in normal bone and in pathological conditions such as osteoporosis and disease.

Kim et have integrated the experimental evidences on crosstalk mechanisms between the two pathways into a pathway and have identified the existence of a hidden positive feedback loop and suggest that this positive feedback loop might participate in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. This model is described in the A hidden oncogenic positive feedback loop caused by crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways. Kim Rath Kolch Cho KH. Oncogene The Wnt and the extracellular signal regulated-kinase pathways are both involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds cancers. the existence of crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways was reported. Gathering all reported we have discovered a positive feedback loop embedded in the crosstalk between Wnt and ERK pathways. We have developed a plausible model that represents the role of this hidden positive feedback loop in the pathway crosstalk based on the integration of experimental reports and employing established basic mathematical models of each pathway. Our analysis shows that the positive feedback loop can generate bistability in both the Wnt and ERK signaling this prediction was further validated by experiments. In using the commonly accepted assumption that mutations in signaling proteins contribute to we have found two conditions through which mutations could evoke an irreversible response leading to a sustained activation of both pathways. One condition is enhanced production of the other is a reduction of the velocity MAP kinase This enables that high activities of Wnt and ERK pathways are maintained even without a persistent extracellular signal. our study adds a novel aspect to the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis by showing that mutational changes in individual proteins can cause fundamental functional changes well beyond the pathway they function in by a positive feedback loop embedded in crosstalk. crosstalk between signaling pathways provides a vehicle through which mutations of individual components can affect properties of the system at a larger scale.

This model is not completely described in all details the publication. Thanks go to Barbara Szomolay and Lutz Brusch for finding and clarifying this. According to Dr. Brusch this model represents the mechanism identified by the qualitative analysis in the article scenario deemed most useful by the authors. For time-course simulations it was necessary to add a time dependency to one of the which is only verbally described in the article. As argued in the publication switch between early and late endosomes can be triggered by a parameter change. While with fixed parameter values each switch just converges to one steady state from its initial conditions and stays endosomes should switch between two different states. These changes would in reality of course depend on many different such as cargo composition and amount in the specific its location and some additional cellular control mechanisms and encompass many different parameters. To keep the model simple authors chose to add a time dependency to only one reaction ke in the activation of RAB5 is multiplied with a term monotonously increasing over time from to They also hard coded a time dependence in this to make the switch occur after several hundred minutes. As long as this modulating term remains monotonic all resulting time courses should look with the switching behavior depending on the initial conditions and whether the term is increasing or decreasing. Monotonic increase is a reasonable assumption for the described mechanism of cargo accumulation.

Lebeda Adler Erickson Chushak Y. J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently its zinc-dependent catalytic domain translocates into the neuroplasm where it cleaves a vesicle-docking to block neurally evoked cholinergic neurotransmission. We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis skeletal muscles induced by at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of first-order differential equations. In this the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson Pharmacol Exp Ther was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin a new species and rate were added at the beginning of reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme. This unbound initial species is transformed at a rate determined by to a free species that is capable of binding. By systematically adjusting the values of 4-step model simulated the rapid decline in NMJ function the less rapid onset of paralysis in mice following i.m. injections and the slow onset of the therapeutic effects of in man. This minimal modeling approach was not only verified by simulating experimental it helped to quantitatively define the time available for an inhibitor to have some effect and the relation between this time and the rate of paralysis onset. The 4-step model predicted that as the rate of paralysis becomes the estimated upper limits of for impermeable inhibitors become longer. More this modeling approach may be useful in studying the kinetics of other toxins or viruses that invade host cells by similar receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The role of cell size and shape in controlling local intracellular signaling and how this spatial information originates and is not well understood. We have used partial differential equations to model the flow of spatial information from the beta-adrenergic receptor to through the network in neurons using real geometries. The numerical simulations indicated that cell shape controls the dynamics of local biochemical activity of signal-modulated negative such as phosphodiesterases and protein phosphatases within regulatory loops to determine the size of microdomains activated signaling components.

Calmodulin plays a vital role in mediating bidirectional synaptic plasticity by activating either protein kinase II or protein phosphatase 2B at different calcium concentrations. We propose an allosteric model for calmodulin in which binding to calcium facilitates the transition between a low-affinity and high-affinity state. The four calcium-binding sites are assumed to be nonidentical. The model is consistent with previously reported experimental data for calcium binding to calmodulin.

Biochemistry There is a fast step binding scheme and a slow step binding scheme. The difference lies in the binding of a NO to non-heme site on which may not necessarily be the same site of binding during the initial binding. The rates have been directly used models. This model is described in the Spectral and kinetic studies on the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by nitric oxide. Stone Marletta MA. Biochemistry The soluble form of guanylate cyclase is the only definitive receptor for the signaling agent nitric oxide The enzyme is a heterodimer of homologous subunits in which each subunit binds equiv of 5-coordinate high-spin heme. .NO increases the Vmax of sGC up to 400-fold and has previously been shown to bind the heme to form a 5-coordinate complex. Using stopped-flow it is demonstrated that the binding of .NO to the heme of sGC is a complex process. .NO first binds to the heme form a 6-coordinate nitrosyl which then converts to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex through one of two ways. For of the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex rapidly converts to the 5-coordinate complex. For the remaining of conversion the 6-coordinate nitrosyl complex to a 5-coordinate nitrosyl complex is slow and dependent upon the interaction of .NO with an unidentified non-heme site on the protein. The heme was completely converted to the 5-coordinate state with as little nM and the equilibrium dissociation constant of .NO for activating the enzyme was determined to be or nM. Gel-filtration analysis indicates that the binding of .NO to the heme has no effect on the native molecular mass of the protein. Correlation of electronic absorption spectra with activity measurements indicates that the 5-coordinate nitrosyl form of the enzyme is activated relative to the resting 5-coordinate ferrous form of the enzyme.

This model is described in the A computational model for understanding stem trophectoderm and endoderm lineage determination. Chickarmane Peterson C PloS one. Recent studies have associated the transcription Sox2 and Nanog as parts of a self-regulating network which is responsible for maintaining embryonic stem cell self renewal and pluripotency. In mutual antagonism between two of these and other master regulators have been shown to regulate lineage determination. In an excess of Cdx2 over Oct4 determines the trophectoderm lineage whereas an excess of Gata-6 over Nanog determines differentiation into the endoderm lineage. studies of the master regulator Oct4 have revealed that some as well differentiation genes are expressed in a biphasic manner with respect to the concentration of Oct4. PRINCIPAL We construct a dynamical model of a minimalistic extracted from ChIP-on-chip and microarray data as well literature studies. The model is based upon differential equations and makes two plausible activation of Gata-6 by Oct4 and repression of Nanog by an Oct4-Gata-6 heterodimer. With these the results of simulations successfully describe the biphasic behavior as well lineage commitment. The model also predicts that reprogramming the network from a differentiated in particular the endoderm into a stem cell is best achieved by over-expressing rather than by suppression of differentiation genes such as Gata-6. The computational model provides a mechanistic understanding of how different lineages arise from the dynamics of underlying regulatory network. It provides a framework to explore strategies of reprogramming a cell from differentiated state to a stem cell state through directed perturbations.

This model is described in the A computational model for understanding stem trophectoderm and endoderm lineage determination. Chickarmane Peterson C PloS one. Recent studies have associated the transcription Sox2 and Nanog as parts of a self-regulating network which is responsible for maintaining embryonic stem cell self renewal and pluripotency. In mutual antagonism between two of these and other master regulators have been shown to regulate lineage determination. In an excess of Cdx2 over Oct4 determines the trophectoderm lineage whereas an excess of Gata-6 over Nanog determines differentiation into the endoderm lineage. studies of the master regulator Oct4 have revealed that some as well differentiation genes are expressed in a biphasic manner with respect to the concentration of Oct4. PRINCIPAL We construct a dynamical model of a minimalistic extracted from ChIP-on-chip and microarray data as well literature studies. The model is based upon differential equations and makes two plausible activation of Gata-6 by Oct4 and repression of Nanog by an Oct4-Gata-6 heterodimer. With these the results of simulations successfully describe the biphasic behavior as well lineage commitment. The model also predicts that reprogramming the network from a differentiated in particular the endoderm into a stem cell is best achieved by over-expressing rather than by suppression of differentiation genes such as Gata-6. The computational model provides a mechanistic understanding of how different lineages arise from the dynamics of underlying regulatory network. It provides a framework to explore strategies of reprogramming a cell from differentiated state to a stem cell state through directed perturbations.

Vitamin modeled as a reduction in the of methionine synthase results in a secondary folate deficiency via the accumulation of folate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate One form of homeostasis is revealed by the fact that a 100-fold up-regulation of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase to occur at the dramatically increases pyrimidine production without affecting the other reactions of the folate cycle. The model also predicts that an almost total inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is required to significantly inhibit the thymidylate synthase consistent with experimental and clinical studies on the effects of methotrexate. Sensitivity to variation in enzymatic parameters tends to be local in the cycle and inversely proportional to the number of reactions that interconvert two folate substrates. Another form of homeostasis is a consequence of the nonenzymatic binding of folate substrates to enzymes. Without folate the velocities of reactions decrease approximately linearly as total folate is decreased. In the presence of folate binding and allosteric the velocities show a remarkable constancy as total folate is decreased.

Ammonium assimilation in Escherichia coli is regulated through multiple mechanisms signal transduction leading to covalent and which affect the activities of its two ammonium-assimilating i.e. glutamine synthetase and glutamate dehydrogenase Much is known about the kinetic properties of the components regulatory network that these enzymes are part but the ways in and the extents to which the network leads to subtle and quasi-intelligent regulation are unappreciated. To determine whether our present knowledge of the interactions between and the kinetic properties of the components this network is complete to the extent that when integrated in a kinetic model it suffices to calculate observed physiological behaviour we now construct a kinetic model of this based on all of the kinetic data on the components that is available in the literature. We use this model to analyse regulation of ammonium assimilation at various carbon statuses for cells that have adapted to low and high ammonium concentrations. We show how a sudden increase in ammonium availability brings about a rapid redirection of the ammonium assimilation flux from synthase to GDH. The extent of redistribution depends on the nitrogen and carbon status of the cell. We develop a method to quantify the relative importance of the various regulators in the network. We find the importance is shared among regulators. We confirm that the adenylylation state of GS is the major regulator but that a total of the regulation is mediated by ADP glutamate glutamine and ATP The total steady-state ammonium assimilation flux is remarkably robust against changes in the ammonium but fluxes through GS and GDH are completely nonrobust. Gene expression of GOGAT above a threshold value makes expression of GS under ammonium-limited and of GDH under glucose-limited sufficient for ammonium assimilation.

Using a combination of live-cell flow and we find that initiator caspases are active during the long and variable delay that precedes mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and effector caspase activation. When combined with a mathematical model of core apoptosis experimental perturbation of regulatory links between initiator and effector caspases reveals that XIAP and proteasome-dependent degradation of effector caspases are important in restraining activity during the pre-MOMP delay.

We exploit experimental and computational approaches to reveal how a concordant interplay between the insulin and epidermal growth factor signaling networks can potentiate mitogenic signaling. In HEK293 insulin is a poor activator of the signal-regulated yet it enhances ERK activation by low EGF doses. We find that major crosstalk mechanisms that amplify ERK signaling are localized upstream of Ras and at the level. Computational modeling unveils how critical network the adaptor proteins GAB1 and insulin receptor substrate Src and phosphatase convert insulin-induced increase in the concentration into enhanced activity. The model predicts and experiments confirm that insulin-induced amplification of mitogenic signaling is abolished by disrupting positive feedback via GAB1 and IRS. We demonstrate that GAB1 behaves as a non-linear amplifier of mitogenic responses and insulin endows EGF signaling with robustness to GAB1 suppression.

This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene-protein network governing the transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling transition.

Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability.

The levels of interactions within large GRNs are of enormous depth and complexity. Details about many GRNs are but in most cases it is unknown to what extent they control a given i.e. the grade of completeness is uncertain. This uncertainty stems from limited experimental which is the main bottleneck for creating detailed dynamical models of cellular processes. Parameter estimation for each node is often infeasible for very large GRNs. We propose a based on random parameter estimations through Monte-Carlo simulations to measure completeness grades of GRNs. We developed a heuristic to assess the completeness of large using ODE simulations under different conditions and randomly sampled parameter sets to detect parameter-invariant effects of perturbations. To test this we constructed the first ODE model of the whole sea urchin endomesoderm one of the best studied large GRNs. We find that nearly of the parameter-invariant effects correspond with experimental which is of the expected optimal agreement obtained from a submodel for which kinetic parameters were estimated and used for simulations. Randomized versions of the model reproduce only of the experimental data. The method described in this paper enables an evaluation of network topologies GRNs without requiring any parameter values. The benefit of this method is exemplified in the first mathematical analysis of the complete Endomesoderm Network Model. The predictions we provide deliver candidate nodes in the network that are likely to be erroneous or miss unknown which may need additional experiments to improve the network topology. This mathematical model can serve as a scaffold for detailed and more realistic models. We propose that our method can be used to assess a completeness grade of any GRN.

We show how the occurrence of oscillations depends on aldolase GAPD and how the oscillation period depends on the phosphofructokinase activity. We propose that the ratio of glucokinase and aldolase GAPD activities are adequate as characteristics of the glucose rather than only the glucokinase activity. We also propose that the rapid equilibrium between different oligomeric forms of phosphofructokinase may reduce the oscillation period sensitivity to phosphofructokinase activity. we show that a satisfying description of phosphofructokinase kinetics can be achieved using the irreversible Hill equation with allosteric modifiers.

This is achieved by wiring signalling pathways such that they can interact with each a phenomenon often called crosstalk. In this we employ mathematical modelling techniques to analyse dynamic mechanisms and measures of crosstalk. We present a dynamic mathematical model that compiles current knowledge about the wiring of pheromone pathway and the filamentous growth pathway in yeast. We consider the main dynamic features and the interconnections between two pathways in order to study dynamic crosstalk between these two pathways in haploid cells. We introduce two new measures of dynamic the intrinsic specificity and the extrinsic specificity. These two measures incorporate the combined signal of several stimuli being present simultaneously and seem to be more stable than previous measures. When both pathways are responsive and the model predicts that the filamentous growth pathway amplifies the response of pheromone and the pathway inhibits response of filamentous growth pathway in terms of mitogen activated protein kinase activity and transcriptional respectively. Among several mechanisms we identified leakage of activated Ste11 as the most influential source of crosstalk. we propose new experiments and predict their outcomes in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of crosstalk between the two pathways.

A major effort was devoted to compare the use of ordinary differential equations with stochastic differential equations in pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modelling. A temperature model was formulated including circadian heat and a thermoregulatory set-point. This model was formulated as a mixed-effects model based on SDEs using NONMEM. The effects of IL-21 were on the set-point and circadian rhythm of metabolism. The model was able to describe a complex set of IL-21 induced including disappearance of the circadian no effect after first and high variability after second dose. SDEs provided a more realistic description with improved simulation and further changed the model into one that could not be falsified by the autocorrelation function.

This demonstrated the differential expression of various regulons. Subsequent single-cell analyses using promoter-gfp fusions confirmed our microarray results. only part of the vegetative subpopulation highly and transiently expresses genes encoding the extracellular proteases Bpr and AprE both of which are under the control of DegU transcriptional regulator.

Despite a thorough knowledge base of Escherichia central metabolism and its fundamental aspects of the employed sensing and regulatory adjustment mechanisms remain unclear. In this using a differential equation model that couples enzymatic and transcriptional regulation of E. central we show that the interplay of known interactions explains in molecular-level detail the system-wide adjustments of metabolic operation between glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. We show that these adaptations are enabled by an indirect recognition of carbon sources through a mechanism we termed distributed sensing of intracellular metabolic fluxes. This mechanism uses two general motifs to establish flux-signaling whose bindings to transcription factors form flux sensors. As these sensors are embedded in global feedback loop closed-loop self-regulation can emerge within metabolism itself and metabolic operation may adapt itself autonomously requiring upstream sensing and to fluctuating carbon sources.

The model focuses on the pyruvate and acetaldehyde branch points where overflow metabolism occurs when the growth changes from oxidative to oxido-reductive. The model is designed to describe the onset of aerobic alcoholic fermentation during steady-state as well under dynamical by triggering an increase in the glycolytic flux using a key signalling component which is assumed to be closely related to acetaldehyde. An investigation of the modelled process dynamics in a continuous cultivation revealed multiple steady states in a region of dilution rates around the transition between oxidative and oxido-reductive growth. A bifurcation analysis using the two external dilution and the inlet concentration of as showed that a fold bifurcation occurs close to the critical dilution rate resulting in multiple steady-states. The region of dilution rates within which multiple steady states may occur depends strongly on the substrate feed concentration. Consequently a single steady state may prevail at low feed whereas multiple steady states may occur over a relatively wide range of dilution rates at higher feed concentrations.

Among these metabolic alterations seem to play an important role. We recently discovered that yeast cells with reduced activity of the key glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase exhibit an increased resistance to the thiol-oxidizing reagent diamide. Here we show that this phenotype is conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans and that the underlying mechanism is based on a redirection of the metabolic flux from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate altering the redox equilibrium of the cytoplasmic pool. another key glycolytic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is known to be inactivated in response to various oxidant and we show that this provokes a similar redirection of the metabolic flux. The naturally occurring inactivation of GAPDH functions as a metabolic switch for rerouting the carbohydrate flux to counteract oxidative stress. As a altering the homoeostasis of cytoplasmic metabolites is a fundamental mechanism for balancing the redox state of eukaryotic cells under stress conditions.

Models for the diversity and evolution of pathogens have branched into two main the adaptive dynamics of quantitative life-history traits and the maintenance invasion of antigenically diverse strains that interact with the immune memory. In a first attempt to reconcile these two we developed a simple modelling framework where two strains of defined by a pair of life-history traits period and interfere through a given level of cross-immunity. We used whooping cough as a potential but the framework proposed here could be applied to other acute infectious diseases. we analysed the effects of these parameters on the invasion dynamics of one strain into a where the second strain is endemic. Whereas the deterministic version of the model converges towards stable coexistence of the two strains in most stochastic simulations showed that transient epidemic dynamics can cause the extinction of either strain. Thus ecological modulated by the immune eventually determine the adaptive value of different pathogen genotypes. We advocate an integrative view of pathogen dynamics at the crossroads of epidemiology and as a way towards efficient control of infectious diseases.

Based on biochemical data from HeLa we have developed a computational model of apoptosome-dependent caspase activation that was sufficient to remodel the rapid kinetics of effector caspase activation observed in vivo. Sensitivity analyses predicted a critical role for caspase-3-dependent feedback signalling and the X-linked-inhibitor-of-apoptosis-protein but a less prominent role for the XIAP antagonist Smac. Single-cell experiments employing a caspase fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate verified these model predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. XIAP was predicted to control this all-or-none with concentrations as high microM but concentrations significantly blocking substrate cleavage. Overexpression of XIAP within these threshold concentrations produced cells showing slow effector caspase activation and submaximal substrate cleavage.

They can affect every but also the organism as a whole. Results we present a kinematic model of the dynamic system of iron pools and fluxes. It is based on ferrokinetic data and chemical measurements in C57BL6 wild-type mice maintained on or iron-loaded diet. The tracer iron levels in major tissues and organs were followed for days. The evaluation resulted in a whole-body model of fractional clearance rates. The analysis permits calculation of absolute flux rates in the of iron distribution into different of tracer-accessible pool sizes and of residence times iron in the different compartments in response to three states of iron-repletion induced by the dietary regime. Conclusions This mathematical model presents a comprehensive physiological picture of mice under three different diets with varying iron contents. The quantitative results reflect systemic properties of iron dynamic hierarchy of time switch-over response and dynamics of iron storage in parenchymal organs. we could assess which parameters will change under dietary perturbations and study in quantitative terms when those changes take place.

Normally found in growing yeast cells and other organisms only as trehalose becomes a crucial protector of proteins and membranes against a variety of including osmotic or oxidative and exposure to toxicants. Trehalose is produced from glucose 6-phosphate and uridine diphosphate glucose in a two-step and recycled to glucose by trehalases.

Lebeda Adler Erickson Chushak Y. J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn Experimental studies have demonstrated that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A causes flaccid paralysis by a multi-step mechanism. Following its binding to specific receptors at peripheral cholinergic nerve is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis.

We tested the hypothesis that mathematical models having a minimal number of reactions and reactants can simulate published data concerning the onset of paralysis skeletal muscles induced by at the isolated rat neuromuscular junction and in other systems. Experimental data from several laboratories were simulated with two different models that were represented by sets of first-order differential equations. In this the 3-step sequential model developed by Simpson Pharmacol Exp Ther was used to estimate upper limits of the times during which anti-toxins and other impermeable inhibitors of can exert an effect. The experimentally determined binding reaction rate was verified to be consistent with published estimates for the rate constants for binding to and dissociating from its receptors. Because this 3-step model was not designed to reproduce temporal changes in paralysis with different toxin a new species and rate were added at the beginning of reaction sequence to create a 4-step scheme.

Deficits in glutathione have been implicated in aging and a host of diseases including cardiovascular Down syndrome and autism. We explore the properties of glutathione metabolism in the liver by experimenting with a mathematical model of one-carbon the transsulfuration and glutathione breakdown. The model is based on known properties of the enzymes and regulation of those enzymes by oxidative stress. We explore the half-life of regulation glutathione and its sensitivity to fluctuations in amino acid input. We use the model to simulate the metabolic profiles previously observed in Down syndrome and autism compare the model results to clinical data. We show that the glutathione pools in hepatic cells and in the blood are quite insensitive to fluctuations in amino acid input and offer an explanation based on model predictions. In we show that hepatic glutathione pools are highly sensitive to the level of oxidative stress. The model shows that overexpression of genes on chromosome and an increase in oxidative stress can explain the metabolic profile of Down syndrome.

Lemaire Tobin Greller Cho Suva LJ. J Theor Biol.2004 Aug We propose a mathematical model explaining the interactions between osteoblasts and two cell types specialized in the maintenance of bone integrity. Bone is a living tissue whose structure and shape continuously evolves during life. It has the ability to change architecture by removal of old bone and replacement with newly formed bone in a localized process called remodeling. The model described here is based on the idea that relative proportions of immature and mature osteoblasts control the degree of osteoclastic activity. In osteoclasts control osteoblasts differentially depending on their stage of differentiation. Despite the tremendous complexity of the bone regulatory system and its fragmentary we obtain surprisingly good correlations between the model simulations and the experimental observations extracted from the literature. The model results corroborate all behaviors of the bone remodeling system that we have including the tight coupling between osteoblasts and the catabolic effect induced by continuous administration of the catabolic action of as well its reversal by soluble antagonist OPG. The model is also able to simulate metabolic bone diseases such as estrogen vitamin D senescence and glucocorticoid excess. possible routes for therapeutic interventions are tested and evaluated. Our model confirms that anti-resorptive therapies are unable to partially restore bone whereas formation therapies yield better results. The model enables us to determine and evaluate potential therapies based on their efficacy. In the model predicts that combinations of anti-resorptive and anabolic therapies provide significant benefits compared with especially for certain type of skeletal disease. the model clearly indicates that increasing the size of pool preosteoblasts is an essential ingredient for the therapeutic manipulation of bone formation. This model was conceived as the first step in a bone turnover modeling platform. These initial modeling results are extremely encouraging and lead us to proceed with additional explorations into bone turnover and skeletal remodeling.

Komarova SV. Endocrinology.2005 To restore falling plasma calcium PTH promotes liberation from bone. PTH targets bone-forming to increase expression of the cytokine receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand which then stimulates osteoclastic bone resorption. whereas continuous administration of PTH decreases bone intermittent PTH has an anabolic effect on which was proposed to arise from direct effects of PTH on osteoblastic bone formation. antiresorptive therapies impair the ability of PTH to increase bone indicating a complex role for osteoclasts in the process. We developed a mathematical model that describes the actions of PTH at a single site of bone where osteoclasts and osteoblasts are regulated by local autocrine and paracrine factors. It was assumed that PTH acts only to increase the production of RANKL by osteoblasts. As a PTH stimulated osteoclasts upon followed by compensatory osteoblast activation due to the coupling of osteoblasts to osteoclasts through local paracrine factors. Continuous PTH administration resulted in net bone because resorption preceded bone formation at all times. In over a wide range of model short application of PTH resulted in a net increase in bone because osteoclasts were rapidly removed upon PTH enabling osteoblasts to rebuild the bone. In excellent agreement with experimental increase in the rate of osteoclast death abolished the anabolic effect of PTH on bone.

Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter and considerable latitude in the shape of oscillatory potentials.

We have used fluorescent reporter systems imaged in living and stochastic computer modeling to explore the relationships of p38MAPK generation reactive oxygen species proteasome and inclusion body formation. In cells expressing a polyQ protein body formation was preceded by proteasome inhibition but cytotoxicity was greatly reduced by administration of a p38MAPK inhibitor. Computer simulations suggested that without the generation of proteasome inhibition and activation of p38MAPK would have significantly reduced toxicity.

Under normal cellular p53 is kept at low levels by Mdm2 but when cells are p53 is stabilised and may then interact with GSK3beta.

The model predicts that high levels of DNA damage leads to increased activity of p53 and GSK3beta low levels of aggregation but if DNA damage is the aggregates are eventually cleared. The model also shows that over long periods of aggregates may start to form due stochastic events leading to increased levels of ROS and damaged DNA.

Sys Epub Feb Cellular senescence--the permanent arrest of cycling in normally proliferating cells such as fibroblasts--contributes both to age-related loss of mammalian tissue homeostasis and acts as a tumour suppressor mechanism. The pathways leading to establishment of senescence are proving to be more complex than was previously envisaged. Combining in-silico interactome analysis and functional target gene stochastic modelling and live cell we show here that there exists a dynamic feedback loop that is triggered by a DNA damage response which after a delay of several locks the cell into an actively maintained state of cellular senescence. The essential feature of the loop is that long-term activation of the checkpoint gene CDKN1A induces mitochondrial dysfunction and production of reactive oxygen species through serial signalling These ROS in turn replenish short-lived DNA damage foci and maintain an ongoing DDR. We show that this loop is both necessary and sufficient for the stability of growth arrest during the establishment of senescent phenotype.

Proctor Tangeman Ardley HC. PLoS One. Oct Overexpression of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 leads to inclusion formation in response to proteasome impairment. These inclusions contain components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and α-synuclein confirming that the ubiquitin-proteasome system plays an important role in protein aggregation. The processes involved are very complex and so we have chosen to take a systems biology approach to examine the system whereby we combine mathematical modelling with experiments in an iterative process. The experiments show that cells are very heterogeneous with respect to inclusion formation and so we use stochastic simulation. The model shows that the variability is partly due to stochastic effects but also depends on protein expression levels of UCH-L1 within cells. The model also indicates that the aggregation process can start even before any proteasome inhibition is but that proteasome inhibition greatly accelerates aggregation progression. This leads to less efficient protein degradation and hence more aggregation suggesting that there is a vicious cycle. proteasome inhibition may not necessarily be the initiating event. Our combined modelling and experimental approach show that stochastic effects play an important role in the aggregation process and could explain the variability in age of disease onset. our model provides a valuable as it can be easily modified and extended to incorporate new experimental test hypotheses and make testable predictions.

Our synthetic ecosystem resembles canonical systems in terms of logic and dynamics. The predator cells kill the prey by inducing expression of a killer protein in the while prey rescue the predators by eliciting expression of an antidote protein in the predator. coexistence and oscillatory dynamics of the predator and prey populations are possible depending on the operating conditions as experimentally validated by long-term culturing of the system in microchemostats. A simple mathematical model is developed to capture these system dynamics. Coherent interplay between experiments and mathematical analysis enables exploration of the dynamics interacting populations in a predictable manner.

Ciliberto Novak Tyson JJ J. Cell Biol. Page The morphogenesis checkpoint in budding yeast delays progression through the cell cycle in response to stimuli that prevent bud formation. Central to the checkpoint mechanism is Swe1 normally its activation halts cell cycle progression in G2. We propose a molecular network for Swe1 based on published observations of budding yeast and analogous control signals in fission yeast. The proposed Swe1 network is merged with a model of cyclin-dependent kinase converted into a set of differential equations and studied by numerical simulation. The simulations accurately reproduce the phenotypes of a dozen checkpoint mutants. Among other the model attributes a new role to a kinase known to play a role in Swe1 Hsl1 must also be indirectly responsible for potent inhibition of Swe1 activity. The model supports the idea that morphogenesis like other raises the cell size threshold for progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next. The model reproduces Fig of the paper.

FIH can also hydroxylate ankyrin-repeat domain a large group of proteins which are functionally unrelated but share common structural features. Competition by ARD proteins for FIH is hypothesised to affect FIH activity towards however the extent of this competition and its effect on the HIF-dependent hypoxic response are unknown. Results To analyse if and in which way the protein interaction affects we created a rate equation model. Our model predicts that an oxygen-regulated sequestration of FIH by ARD proteins significantly shapes the characteristics of HIF system. The protein interaction is predicted to create an oxygen threshold for HIFα CAD-hydroxylation and to significantly sharpen the which not only focuses HIFα CAD-hydroxylation into a defined range of oxygen but also makes the response ultrasensitive to varying oxygen tensions. Our model further suggests that the hydroxylation status of the ARD protein pool can encode the strength and duration of a hypoxic which may allow cells to memorise these features for a certain time period after reoxygenation. Conclusions The protein interaction has the potential to contribute oxygen-range can sensitise the response to changes in oxygen and can provide a memory of the strength and duration of a hypoxic episode. These emergent properties are predicted to significantly shape the characteristics of HIF activity in animal cells. We argue that the interaction should be taken into account in studies of the effect pharmacological inhibition of the HIF-hydroxylases and propose that the interaction of a signalling sensor with a large group of proteins might be a general mechanism for the regulation of signalling pathways.

Wang Buzsáki G. J Neurosci. Oct Fast neuronal oscillations have been observed in the neocortex and hippocampus during behavioral arousal. Using computer we investigated the hypothesis that such rhythmic activity can emerge in a random network of interconnected GABAergic fast-spiking interneurons. Specific conditions for the population on properties of single cells and the were identified. These include the that amplitude of spike afterhyperpolarization be above the GABAA synaptic reversal that the ratio between synaptic decay time constant and the oscillation period be sufficiently that the effects of heterogeneities be modest because of a steep frequency-current relationship of fast-spiking neurons. using a population coherence based on coincident firings of neural it is demonstrated that large-scale network synchronization requires a critical average number of synaptic contacts per which is not sensitive to the network size. By changing the GABAA synaptic maximal decay time or the mean external excitatory drive to the neuronal firing frequencies were gradually and monotonically varied. By the network synchronization was found to be high only within a frequency band coinciding with the gamma range. We conclude that the GABAA synaptic transmission provides a suitable mechanism for synchronized gamma oscillations in a sparsely connected network of fast-spiking interneurons. In the interneuronal network can presumably maintain subthreshold oscillations in principal cell populations and serve to synchronize discharges of spatially distributed neurons.

Liu Zhang Tan Hsu Blom Leong Sethi Ho Ding JL and Thiagarajan PS. PLoS Comp. Bio. Jan. The complement system is key to innate immunity and its activation is necessary for the clearance of bacteria and apoptotic cells. insufficient or excessive complement activation will lead to immune-related diseases. It is so far unknown how the complement activity is up- or down- regulated and what the associated pathophysiological mechanisms are. To quantitatively understand the modulatory mechanisms of the complement we built a computational model involving the enhancement and suppression mechanisms that regulate complement activity. Our model consists of a large system of Ordinary Differential Equations accompanied by a dynamic Bayesian network as a probabilistic approximation of the ODE dynamics. Applying Bayesian inference this approximation was used to perform parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis. Our combined computational and experimental study showed that the antimicrobial response is sensitive to changes in pH and calcium which determines the strength of crosstalk between CRP and L-ficolin. Our study also revealed differential regulatory effects of C4BP. While C4BP delays but does not decrease the classical complement it attenuates but does not significantly delay the lectin pathway activation. We also found that the major inhibitory role of C4BP is to facilitate the decay of C3 convertase. In the present work elucidates the regulatory mechanisms of the complement system and demonstrates how the bio-pathway machinery maintains the balance between activation and inhibition.

Lingchong Nat Cell Biol The restriction point marks the critical event when a mammalian cell commits to proliferation and becomes independent of growth stimulation. It is fundamental for normal differentiation and tissue seems to be dysregulated in virtually all cancers. Although the R-point has been linked to various activities involved in the regulation of G1-S transition the mammalian cell underlying mechanism remains unclear. Using single-cell we show here that the Rb-E2F pathway functions as a bistable switch to convert graded serum inputs into all-or-none E2F responses. Once turned ON by sufficient serum E2F can memorize and maintain this ON state independently of continuous serum stimulation. We further show at critical concentrations and duration of serum bistable E2F activation correlates directly with the ability of a cell to traverse the R-point.

Oscillations are abolished if is removed from the external or if the conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber.

Santhosh Palani and Casim A. Molecular Systems Biology The ability to engineer an all-or-none cellular response to a given signaling ligand is important in applications ranging from biosensing to tissue engineering. synthetic gene network switches have been limited in their applicability and tunability due to their reliance on specific components to function. we present a strategy for reversible switch design that instead relies only on a easily constructed network topology with two positive feedback loops and we apply the method to create highly ultrasensitive bistable cellular responses to a synthetic complex. Independent modulation of the two feedback strengths enables rational tuning and some decoupling of steady-state signal switching and kinetic of system activation and response properties. Our integrated computational and synthetic biology approach elucidates design rules for building cellular switches with desired which may be of utility in engineering signal-transduction pathways.

A new mathematical model was developed simulating a duct cell within a proximal pancreatic duct and included a sodium-2-bicarbonate cotransporter and sodium-potassium pump on a chloride-impermeable basolateral CFTR on the luminal membrane with to bicarbonate chloride permeability ratio. Chloride-bicarbonate antiporters were added or subtracted from the basolateral and luminal membranes. The model was integrated over time using XPPAUT.

Limiting permeability to as seen in some CFTR markedly inhibited pancreatic bicarbonate and fluid secretion. A simple CFTR-dependent duct cell model can explain high-concentration bicarbonate secretion in pancreatic juice that reproduces the experimental findings. This model may also provide insight into why CFTR mutations that predominantly affect bicarbonate permeability predispose to pancreatic dysfunction in humans.

Amongst it is severely influenced by the properties and inter-individual variability of the enzymes and transporters of the drug detoxification system of the liver. Predicting individual drug biotransformation capacity requires quantitative and detailed models. In this contribution we present the de novo deterministic modeling of atorvastatin biotransformation based on comprehensive published knowledge on involved metabolic and transport pathways as well physicochemical properties. The model was evaluated in primary human hepatocytes and parameter identifiability analysis was performed under multiple experimental constraints. Dynamic simulations of atorvastatin biotransformation considering the inter-individual variability of the two major involved enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A3 based on quantitative protein expression data in a large human liver bank highlighted the variability in individual biotransformation profiles and therefore also points to the individuality of pharmacokinetics. A dynamic model for the biotransformation of atorvastatin has been developed using quantitative metabolite measurements in primary human hepatocytes. The model comprises kinetics for transport processes and metabolic enzymes as well population liver expression data allowing us to assess the impact of inter-individual variability concentrations of key proteins.

Mathematical Medicine and BiologyVolume Issue March Pages Thrombin is an enzyme that is generated in both vascular and non-vascular systems. In blood a fundamental process in all thrombin induces the formation of a fibrin clot. A dynamical model of thrombin generation in the presence of lipid surfaces is presented. This model also includes the self-regulating thrombin feedback the thrombomodulin-protein C-protein S inhibitory tissue factor pathway inhibitor and the antithrombin The dynamics of this complex system were found to be highly lipid as would be expected from experimental studies. Simulations of this model indicate that a threshold lipid level is required to generate physiologically relevant amounts of thrombin. The dependence of the peak and duration of thrombin generation on lipid was saturable. The lipid concentration affects the way in which the inhibitors modulate thrombin production. A novel feature of this model is the inclusion of dynamical protein C initiated by thrombin feedback. This inhibitory system exerts its effects on the lipid where its substrates are formed. The maximum impact of TFPI occurs at intermediate vesicle concentrations. Inhibition by AT is only indirectly affected by the lipid since AT irreversibly binds only to solution phase proteins. In a system with normal plasma concentrations of the proteins involved in thrombin the combination of these three inhibitors is sufficient both to effectively stop thrombin generation prior to the exhaustion of its and to inhibit all thrombin formed. This model can be used to predict thrombin generation under extreme lipid conditions that are difficult to implement experimentally and to examine thrombin generation in non-vascular systems.

A mathematical simulation of the tissue factor pathway to the generation of thrombin has been developed using a combination of and deduced rate constants for reactions involving the activation of factor and in the formation of as well rate constants for the assembly of coagulation enzyme complexes which involve factor VIIIa-factor IXa and factor Va-Xa assembled on phospholipid membrane. Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of tissue factor a physical constraint associated with the stability of factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates each of the proteins in coagulation reaction through a range of initiator VIIa-tissue concentrations ranging from pM to nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor and their respective activated factor VIIIa and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data. The computer model permits the assessment of reaction over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management of reaction studies.

How variable TGF-β ligand doses quantitatively control intracellular signaling dynamics and how continuous ligand doses are translated into discontinuous cellular fate decisions remain poorly understood. Using a combined experimental and mathematical modeling we discovered that cells respond differently to continuous and pulsating TGF-β stimulation. The pathway elicits a transient signaling response to a single pulse of TGF-β whereas it is capable of integrating repeated pulses of ligand stimulation at short time resulting in sustained phospho-Smad2 and transcriptional responses. the TGF-β pathway displays different sensitivities to ligand doses at different time scales.

Such networks are extremely complex due to multiple feedback loops in combination with shared signal and cross-talk between signal pathways. We present a novel framework that integrates experimental work and mathematical modeling to quantitatively characterize the role and relation between co-existing submechanisms in complex signaling networks. The approach is independent of knowing or uniquely estimating model parameters because it only relies on rejections and core predictions identified properties in unidentifiable The power of our approach is demonstrated through numerous iterations between model-based data and theoretical predictions to characterize the relative role of co-existing feedbacks governing insulin signaling. We examined phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and substrate-1 endocytosis of the receptor in response to various different experimental perturbations in primary human adipocytes. The analysis revealed that receptor endocytosis is necessary for two identified feedback mechanisms involving mass and information respectively.

Neurodegeneration is an age-related disorder which is characterised by the accumulation of aggregated protein and neuronal cell death. There are many different neurodegenerative diseases which are classified according to the specific proteins involved and the regions of brain which are affected. Despite individual there are common mechanisms at the sub-cellular level leading to loss of protein homeostasis. The two central systems in protein homeostasis are the chaperone which promotes correct protein and the cellular proteolytic which degrades misfolded or damaged proteins. Since these systems and their interactions are very we use mathematical modelling to aid understanding of the processes involved. The model developed in this study focuses on the role of Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones in preventing both protein aggregation and cell death. Simulations were performed under three different no transient stress due to an increase in reactive oxygen and high stress due to sustained increases in reactive oxygen species. The model predicts that protein homeostasis can be maintained during short periods of stress. under long periods of the chaperone system becomes overwhelmed and the probability of cell death pathways being activated increases. Simulations were also run in which cell death mediated by the JNK and p38 pathways was inhibited. The model predicts that inhibiting either or both of these pathways may delay cell death but does not stop the aggregation process and that eventually cells die due to aggregated protein inhibiting proteasomal function. This problem can be overcome if the sequestration of aggregated protein into inclusion bodies is enhanced. This model predicts responses to reactive oxygen species-mediated stress that are consistent with currently available experimental data.

The results are highly variable with respect to insulin clearance and the relative contributions of hepatic and renal insulin degradation.

Hepatic insulin receptor activation by insulin receptor internalization and autophosphorylation is explicitly included in the model.

Stationary model analysis shows that degradation relative contributions of the different tissues to total insulin degradation and clearance highly depend on the insulin concentration. This study provides a detailed dynamic model of insulin concentration in the blood and of insulin receptor activation in hepatocytes.

Based on extensive time-series data from in vivo reporter gene we developed a model of the Ostreococcus clock as a feedback loop between the genes TOC1 and CCA1. The model reproduces the dynamics of transcriptional and translational reporters over a range of photoperiods. the model is also able to predict the transient behaviour of the clock when light conditions are altered. Despite the apparent simplicity of the clock it displays considerable complexity in its response to changing light conditions. Systematic screening of the effects altered day length revealed a complex relationship between phase and which is also captured by the model. The complex light response is shown to stem from circadian gating of light-dependent mechanisms. This study provides insights into the contributions of light inputs to the Ostreococcus clock.

This paper describes the mathematical modelling of a part the blood coagulation mechanism. The model includes the activation of factor X by a purified enzyme from Viper Venom factor V and also comprises the inactivation of products formed. In this study we assume that in principle the mechanism of process is known. the exact structure of the mechanism is and the process still can be described by different mathematical models. These models are put to test by measuring their capacity to explain the course of thrombin generation as observed in plasma after recalcification in presence of RVV. The mechanism studied is mathematically modelled as a system of differential-algebraic equations Each candidate model contains some which is expressed in the model equations by the presence of unknown parameters. For reaction constants or initial concentrations are unknown. The goal of parameter estimation is to determine these unknown parameters in such a way that the theoretical results fit the experimental data within measurement accuracy and to judge which modifications of the chemical reaction scheme allow the best fit.

Aug Epub Feb The operating principles of complex regulatory networks are best understood with the help of mathematical modelling rather than by intuitive reasoning. we study the dynamics of mitotic exit control system in budding yeast by further developing the model. A comprehensive systems view of the network regulating ME is provided based on classical experiments in the literature. In this Cdc20-APC is a critical node controlling both cyclin and phosphatase branches of the regulatory network. On the basis of experimental situations ranging from single to quintuple the kinetic parameters of the network are estimated. Numerical analysis of the model quantifies dependence of ME control on the proteolytic and non-proteolytic functions of separase. We show that the requirement of non-proteolytic function separase for ME depends on cyclin-dependent kinase activity. The model is also used for the systematic analysis of the recently discovered Cdc14 endocycles. The significance of Cdc14 endocycles in eukaryotic cell cycle control is discussed as well.

We show that interactions between the oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute significance only. It is to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply.

These bursts often have a regular repeating with a period of s. In some the bursts are clustered into bursts of which we call compound bursting. Consistent with this are recordings of free oxygen mitochondrial membrane and intraislet glucose levels that exhibit very slow with faster oscillations superimposed. We describe a new mathematical model of the pancreatic beta-cell that can account for these multimodal patterns. The model includes the feedback of cytosolic onto ion channels that can account for and a metabolic subsystem that is capable of producing slow oscillations driven by in glycolysis. This slow rhythm is responsible for the slow mode of compound bursting in the model.

We have proposed that the Phase response results from the combined depolarizing influences of potassium channel closure and an nonselective cation current that activates as intracellular calcium stores empty during exposure to basal glucose et The stores refill during Phase deactivating ICRAN and allowing steady-state bursting to commence. We support this hypothesis with additional simulations and experimental results indicating that Phase duration is sensitive to the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. the duration of Phase transient increases with duration of prior exposure to basal reflecting the increased time required to fill calcium stores that have been emptying for longer periods. Phase duration is reduced when islets are exposed to elevated refill calcium stores in the presence of basal glucose. when extracellular calcium is removed during the basal glucose exposure to reduce calcium influx into the Phase duration increases. no Phase is observed following hyperpolarization of the beta-cell membrane with diazoxide in the continued presence of mm a condition in which intracellular calcium stores remain full. Application of carbachol to empty calcium stores during basal glucose exposure did not increase Phase duration as the model predicts.

Mar Pubmed Insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells is with a typical period of reflecting oscillations in membrane potential and the cytosolic concentration. Our central hypothesis is that the slow min oscillations are due to glycolytic whereas faster oscillations that are superimposed due to feedback onto metabolism or ion channels. We extend a previous mathematical model based on this hypothesis to include a more detailed description of mitochondrial metabolism. We demonstrate that this model can account for typical oscillatory patterns of membrane potential and concentration in islets. It also accounts for temporal data on oxygen consumption in islets. A recent challenge to the notion that glycolytic oscillations drive slow in islets are data showing that oscillations in mitochondrial oxygen and levels are all terminated by membrane hyperpolarization. We demonstrate that these data are in fact compatible with a model in which glycolytic oscillations are the key player in rhythmic islet activity. we use the model to address the recent finding that the activity of islets from some mice is uniformly whereas that from islets of other mice is slow.

Unlike previous bursting is driven by the interaction of two slow one with a relatively small time constant and the other with a much larger time constant Bursting on the intermediate time scale is generated without need for a slow process having an intermediate time hence phantom bursting. The model suggests that isolated cells exhibiting a fast pattern may nonetheless possess slower processes that can be brought out by injecting suitable exogenous currents. Guided by we devise an experimental protocol using the dynamic clamp technique that reliably elicits medium period oscillations from isolated cells. we show that strong electrical coupling between a fast burster and a slow burster can produce synchronized medium suggesting that islets may be composed of cells that are intrinsically either fast or with few none that are intrinsically medium.

Garrett Jenkinson and John BMC Systems Biology May The dynamics of biochemical reaction systems are constrained by the fundamental laws of which impose well-defined relationships among the reaction rate constants characterizing these systems. Constructing biochemical reaction systems from experimental observations often leads to parameter values that do not satisfy the necessary thermodynamic constraints. This can result in models that are not physically realizable and may lead to or even descriptions of cellular function. We introduce a thermodynamically consistent model calibration method that can be effectively used to provide thermodynamically feasible values for the parameters of an open biochemical reaction system. The proposed method formulates the model calibration problem as a constrained optimization problem that takes thermodynamic constraints if additional non-thermodynamic into account. By calculating thermodynamically feasible values for the kinetic parameters of a well-known model of the signaling we demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative significance of imposing thermodynamic constraints on these parameters and the effectiveness of our method for accomplishing this important task. MATLAB using the Systems Biology Toolbox can be accessed from An SBML file containing the thermodynamically feasible signaling cascade model can be found in the BioModels database. TCMC is a simple and flexible method for obtaining physically plausible values for the kinetic parameters of open biochemical reaction systems. It can be effectively used to recalculate a thermodynamically consistent set of parameter values for existing thermodynamically infeasible biochemical reaction models of cellular function as well to estimate thermodynamically feasible values for the parameters of new models. TCMC can provide dimensionality better estimation and lower computational can help to alleviate the problem of data overfitting.

BMC Syst Biol. Dec Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and the removal of potentially damaged cells in multicellular organisms. By binding its cognate membrane TNF receptor type the proinflammatory cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor activates pro-apoptotic signaling via caspase but at the same time also stimulates nuclear factor kappaB survival pathways. Differential dose-response relationships of these two major TNF signaling pathways have been described experimentally and using mathematical modeling. the quantitative analysis of the complex interplay between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways is an open question as it is challenging for several the overall signaling network is various time scales are and cells respond quantitatively and qualitatively in a heterogeneous manner. This study analyzes the complex interplay of the crosstalk TNF-R1 induced pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways based on an experimentally validated mathematical model. The model describes the temporal responses on both the single cell level as well the level of a heterogeneous cell as observed in the respective quantitative experiments using TNF-R1 stimuli of different strengths and durations. Global sensitivity of the heterogeneous population was quantified by measuring the average gradient of time death versus each population parameter. This global sensitivity analysis uncovers the concentrations of Caspase-8 and their respective inhibitors BAR and as key elements for deciding the fate. A simulated knockout of the NF-kappaB-mediated anti-apoptotic signaling reveals the importance of this pathway for delaying the time of reducing the death rate in the case of pulse stimulation and significantly increasing cell-to-cell variability. Cell ensemble modeling of a heterogeneous cell population including a global sensitivity analysis presented here allowed us to illuminate the role of different elements and parameters on apoptotic signaling. The receptors serve to transmit the external procaspases and their inhibitors control the switching from life to while NF-kappaB enhances the heterogeneity of cell population.

The hypothesis states that mitochondrial and cytosolic CK plays a pivotal role in the transport of high-energy phosphate groups from mitochondria to myofibrils in contracting muscle. Temporal buffering of changes in ATP and ADP is another potential role of CK. With a mathematical we analyzed energy transport and damping of high peaks ATP hydrolysis during the cardiac cycle. The analysis was based on multiscale data measured at the level of isolated mitochondria and on dynamic response times of oxidative phosphorylation measured at the whole heart level. Using ensemble we derived confidence intervals for predictions of the contributions by phosphocreatine and ATP to the transfer of HEP from mitochondria to sites of ATP hydrolysis. Our calculations indicate that only of transcytosolic energy transport is carried by contradicting the PCr shuttle hypothesis. We also predicted temporal buffering capabilities of the CK isoforms protecting against high peaks of ATP hydrolysis in myofibrils.

Mellor N Bligh F Chandler I Hodgman C J. Food Sci.2010 The generation of off-flavors in soybean homogenates such as n-hexanal via the lipoxygenase pathway can be a problem in the processed food industry. Previous studies have examined the effect of using soybean varieties missing one or more of the LOX isozymes on n-hexanal generation. A dynamic mathematical model of the soybean LOX pathway using ordinary differential equations was constructed using parameters estimated from existing data with the aim of predicting how n-hexanal generation could be reduced. Time-course simulations of LOX-null beans were run and compared with experimental results. Model and beans were within the range relative to the wild type found with and beans close to the experimental range. Model beans produced much more n-hexanal relative to the wild type than those in experiments. Sensitivity analysis indicates that reducing the estimated parameter for LOX isozyme would improve the fit between model predictions and experimental results found in the literature. The model also predicts that increasing L-3 or reducing L-2 levels within beans may reduce n-hexanal generation. PRACTICAL This work describes the use of mathematics to attempt quantify the enzyme-catalyzed conversions of compounds in soybean homogenates into undesirable primarily from the compound n-hexanal. The effect of different soybean genotypes and enzyme kinetic constants was also leading to recommendations on which combinations might minimize off-flavor levels and what further work might be carried out to substantiate these conclusions.","origin":"BioModels","curated":"Yes"},{"id":"BIOMD0000000416","title":"Muraro2011_Cytokinin-Auxin_CrossRegulation","body":"This model is from the The influence of cytokinin-auxin cross-regulation on cell-fate determination in Arabidopsis thaliana root development Muraro Byrne King Voss Kieber Bennett M.

The hormones auxin and cytokinin control meristem size antagonistically. Local accumulation of auxin promotes cell division and the initiation of a lateral root primordium. By high cytokinin concentrations disrupt the regular pattern of divisions that characterises lateral root and promote differentiation. The way in which the hormones interact is controlled by a genetic regulatory network. In this we propose a deterministic mathematical model to describe this network and present model simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed effects of cytokinin on the expression of auxin regulated genes. We show how auxin response genes and auxin efflux transporters may be affected by the presence of cytokinin. We also analyse and compare the responses of hormones auxin and cytokinin to changes in their supply with the responses obtained by genetic mutations of which encodes a protein that plays a key role in balancing cytokinin and auxin regulation of meristem size. We show that although shy2 mutations can qualitatively reproduce the effect of varying auxin and cytokinin supply on their response some elements of the network respond differently to changes in hormonal supply and to genetic implying a general response of the network. We conclude that an analysis based on the ratio between these two hormones may be misleading and that a mathematical model can serve as a useful tool for stimulate further experimental work by predicting the response of network to changes in hormone levels and to other genetic mutations.","origin":"BioModels","curated":"Yes"},{"id":"BIOMD0000000417","title":"Ratushny2012_NF","body":"This model is from the Asymmetric positive feedback loops reliably control biological responses Alexander V Ramsey A Katherine Stephen Ramsey John D Aitchison Mol Syst Biol.

A key component of this pathway is the stress-activated protein kinase which is rapidly phosphorylated by the SAPK kinase Pbs2 upon hyper-osmotic and which is the terminal kinase of two parallel signalling subsequently called the Sho1 branch and the Sln1 respectively.

Nov The high osmolarity glycerol pathway in yeast serves as a prototype signalling system for eukaryotes. We used an unprecedented amount of data to parameterise models capturing different hypotheses about molecular mechanisms underlying osmo-adaptation and selected a best approximating model. This model implied novel mechanisms regulating osmo-adaptation in yeast. The model suggested that the main mechanism for osmo-adaptation is a fast and transient non-transcriptional Hog1-mediated activation of glycerol the transcriptional response serves to maintain an increased steady-state glycerol production with low steady-state Hog1 and fast negative feedbacks of activated Hog1 on upstream signalling branches serves to stabilise adaptation response. The best approximating model also indicated that homoeostatic adaptive systems with two parallel redundant signalling branches show a more robust and faster response than single-branch systems. We corroborated this notion to a large extent by dedicated measurements of volume recovery in single cells. Our study also demonstrates that systematically testing a model ensemble against data has the potential to achieve a better and unbiased understanding of molecular mechanisms.

The model showed that of these two changes to the rate of LDL-C removal from the plasma with age had the most significant effect on cholesterol metabolism. The original SBML model file was generated using MathSBML This model is described in the A whole-body mathematical model of cholesterol metabolism and its age-associated dysregulation. Mc Auley Wilkinson Jones Kirkwood TT. BMC Syst Biol. Oct Global demographic changes have stimulated marked interest in the process of ageing. There has and will continue to an unrelenting rise in the number of oldest old years of Together with an ageing population there comes an increase in the prevalence of age related disease. Of the diseases of cardiovascular disease has by far the highest prevalence. It is regarded that a finely tuned lipid profile may help to prevent CVD as there is a long established relationship between alterations to lipid metabolism and CVD risk. In fact elevated plasma particularly Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol has consistently stood out as a risk factor for having a cardiovascular event. Moreover it is widely acknowledged that LDL-C may rise with age in both sexes a wide variety of groups. The aim of this work was to use a whole-body mathematical model to investigate why LDL-C rises with and to test the hypothesis that mechanistic changes to cholesterol absorption and LDL-C removal from the plasma are responsible for the rise. The whole-body mechanistic nature of the model differs from previous models of cholesterol metabolism which have either focused on intracellular cholesterol homeostasis or have concentrated on an isolated area of lipoprotein dynamics. The model integrates both current and previously published data relating to molecular ageing and nutrition in an integrated fashion. The model was used to test the hypothesis that alterations to the rate of cholesterol absorption and changes to the rate of removal LDL-C from the plasma are integral to understanding why LDL-C rises with age. The model demonstrates that increasing the rate of intestinal cholesterol absorption from to by age years can result in an increase of LDL-C by as much in a hypothetical male subject. The model also shows that decreasing the rate of hepatic clearance LDL-C gradually to by age years can result in an increase of LDL-C by as much Our model clearly demonstrates that of the two putative mechanisms that have been implicated in the dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism with alterations to the removal rate of plasma LDL-C has the most significant impact on cholesterol metabolism and small changes to the number of hepatic LDL receptors can result in a significant rise in LDL-C. This first whole-body systems based model of cholesterol balance could potentially be used as a tool to further improve our understanding of whole-body cholesterol metabolism and its dysregulation with age. given further fine tuning the model may help to investigate potential dietary and lifestyle regimes that have the potential to mitigate the effects aging has on cholesterol metabolism.

The cell fate decision of multi-potent pancreatic progenitor cells between the exocrine and endocrine lineages is regulated by Notch mediated interactions. canonical models of Notch-mediated lateral inhibition cannot explain the scattered spatial distribution of endocrine cells and the cell-type ratio in the developing pancreas. Based on evidence from acinar-to-islet cell transdifferentiation in we propose that lateral i.e. positive feedback between adjacent progenitor acts in parallel with lateral inhibition to regulate pattern formation in the pancreas. A simple mathematical model of transcriptional regulation and interaction reveals the existence of multi-stability spatial patterns whose simultaneous occurrence causes scattering of endocrine cells in the presence of noise. The scattering pattern allows for control of the endocrine-to-exocrine cell-type ratio by modulation of lateral stabilization strength. These theoretical results suggest a previously unrecognized role for lateral stabilization in lineage spatial patterning and cell-type ratio control in organ development.

December Modeling of biological parts is of crucial importance as it enables the in silico study of synthetic biological systems prior to the actual construction of genetic which can be time consuming and costly. Because standard biological parts are utilized to build the synthetic it is important that each of these standard parts is well characterized and has a corresponding mathematical model that could simulate the characteristics of part.

G protein-coupled receptors regulate a variety of intracellular pathways through their ability to promote the binding of GTP to heterotrimeric G proteins. Regulator of G protein signaling proteins increases the intrinsic GTPase activity of Galpha-subunits and are widely regarded as negative regulators of G protein signaling. Using yeast we demonstrate that GTP hydrolysis is not only required for but is essential for achieving a high maximal response. Thus RGS-mediated GTP hydrolysis acts as both a negative and positive regulator of signaling. To account for this we generated a new kinetic model of the G protein cycle where enters an inactive GTP-bound state following effector activation. in vivo and silico experimentation demonstrates that maximum signaling output first increases and then decreases with RGS concentration. This non-monotone dependence on RGS concentration is novel.

This model corresponds to S1 that comprises negative feedback from MK-PP to MKKK-P layer coupled to positive feedback from MK-PP to MKK-PP layer. This model is described in the Oscillations MAPK cascade triggered by two distinct designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops. Sarma Ghosh I. BMC Res Notes. Jun Feedback both positive and negative are embedded in the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase cascade. In the three layer MAPK both feedback loops originate from the terminal layer and their sites of action are either of the two upstream layers. Recent studies have shown that the cascade uses coupled positive and negative feedback loops in generating oscillations. Two plausible designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops can be elucidated from the in one design the positive feedback precedes the negative feedback in the direction of signal flow and vice-versa in another. But it remains unexplored how the two designs contribute towards triggering oscillations in MAPK cascade. Thus it is also not known how robustness or nature of the oscillations would be shaped by these two designs. We built two models of MAPK cascade that exhibited oscillations as function of two underlying designs of coupled positive and negative feedback loops. amplitude and nature of oscillations were found to be differentially determined by each design. It was observed that the positive feedback emerging from an oscillating MAPK cascade and functional in an external signal processing module can trigger oscillations in the target provided that the target module satisfy certain parametric requirements. The augmentation of the two models was done to incorporate the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of cascade components followed by induction of a nuclear phosphatase. It revealed that the fate of oscillations in the MAPK cascade is governed by the feedback designs.

Pokhilko Mas Millar AJ. BMC Syst Biol 24-hour biological clocks are intimately connected to the cellular signalling which complicates the analysis of clock mechanisms. The transcriptional regulator TOC1 OF CAB EXPRESSION is a founding component of the gene circuit in the plant circadian clock. Recent results show that TOC1 suppresses transcription of multiple target genes within the clock far beyond its previously-described regulation of the morning transcription factors LHY ELONGATED and CCA1 CLOCK ASSOCIATED It is unclear how this pervasive effect of TOC1 affects the dynamics of clock and its outputs. TOC1 also appears to function in a nested feedback loop that includes signalling by the plant hormone Abscisic Acid which is upregulated by abiotic such as drought. ABA treatments both alter TOC1 levels and affect the timing behaviour. clock rhythmically modulates physiological processes induced by such as the closing of stomata in the leaf epidermis. In order to understand the dynamics of clock and its outputs under changing environmental the reciprocal interactions between the clock and other signalling pathways must be integrated. We extended the mathematical model of the plant clock gene circuit by incorporating the repression of multiple clock genes by observed experimentally. The revised model more accurately matches the data on molecular profiles and timing explaining the responses in TOC1 over-expression and toc1 mutant plants. A simplified representation of ABA signalling allowed us to investigate the interactions of ABA and circadian pathways. Increased ABA levels lengthen the free-running period of the consistent with experimental data. Adding stomatal closure to the as a key ABA- and clock-regulated downstream process allowed to describe TOC1 effects on the rhythmic gating of stomatal closure. The integrated model of the circadian clock circuit and ABA-regulated environmental sensing allowed us to explain multiple experimental observations on the timing and stomatal responses to genetic and environmental perturbations. These results crystallise a new role of TOC1 as an environmental which both affects the pace of central oscillator and modulates the kinetics of downstream processes.

Biophys J. Sep Transforming growth factor-β1 is a potent regulator of extracellular matrix wound and immune is implicated in the progression of fibrotic diseases and cancer. Extracellular activation of TGF-β1 from its latent form provides spatiotemporal control over TGF-β1 but the current understanding of TGF-β1 activation does not emphasize cross talk between activators. Plasmin and thrombospondin-1 have been studied individually as activators of and in this work we used a systems-level approach with mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments to study the interplay between PLS and TSP1 in TGF-β1 activation. Simulations and steady-state analysis predicted a switch-like bistable transition between two levels of active with an inverse correlation between PLS and TSP1. In the model predicted that increasing PLS breaks a TSP1-TGF-β1 positive feedback loop and causes an unexpected net decrease in TGF-β1 activation. To test these predictions in we treated rat hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells with which caused proteolytic cleavage of TSP1 and decreased activation of TGF-β1. The TGF-β1 activation levels showed a cooperative dose and a test of hysteresis in the cocultured cells validated that TGF-β1 activation is bistable. We conclude that switch-like behavior arises from natural competition between two distinct modes of TGF-β1 a TSP1-mediated mode of high activation and a PLS-mediated mode of low activation. This switch suggests an explanation for the unexpected effects of the plasminogen activation system on TGF-β1 in fibrotic diseases as well novel prognostic and therapeutic approaches for diseases with TGF-β dysregulation.

Reyes-Palomares Montañez Sánchez-Jiménez Medina MA Amino February Volume Issue pp Many molecular details remain to be uncovered concerning the regulation of polyamine metabolism. A previous model of mammalian polyamine metabolism showed that S-adenosyl methionine availability could play a key role in polyamine homeostasis. To get a deeper insight in this we have built a combined model by integration of the previously published polyamine model and one-carbon glutathione metabolism published by different research groups. The combined model is robust and it is able to achieve physiological steady-state as well to reproduce the predictions of individual models. a transition between two versions of our model with new regulatory factors added properly simulates the switch in methionine adenosyl transferase isozymes occurring when the liver enters in proliferative conditions.

We combined experimental approaches and computational modeling to investigate the mechanisms controlling differentiation and plasticity of T cells in the gut of mice. Our computational model encompasses the major intracellular pathways involved in T cell differentiation into T helper Th17 and induced regulatory T cells Our modeling efforts predicted a critical role for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in modulating plasticity between Th17 and iTreg cells. PPARγ regulates activation and cytokine thereby controlling the induction of effector and regulatory is a promising therapeutic target for dysregulated immune responses and inflammation. Our modeling efforts predict that following PPARγ Th17 cells undergo phenotype switch and become iTreg cells. This prediction was validated by results of adoptive transfer studies showing an increase of colonic iTreg and a decrease of Th17 cells in the gut mucosa of mice with colitis following pharmacological activation of PPARγ. Deletion PPARγ in T cells impaired mucosal iTreg and enhanced colitogenic Th17 responses in mice with T cell-induced colitis. for the first time we provide novel molecular evidence in vivo demonstrating that PPARγ in addition to regulating T cell differentiation also plays a major role controlling Th17 and iTreg plasticity in the gut mucosa.

The model is for condon mRNAs. The building of a multi-factor complex in initiation and also the different processes in elongation and termination are modelled in detail. The model takes into account that ribosomes cover more than one codon of mRNA so that the movement of ribosomes are effectively blocked by other ribosomes several codons downstream. It is assumed that codons are occupied by each ribosome. This blocking effect is considered in reaction R18 initiation and also reaction the where translocation of ribosomes takes place in elongation. The kinetic functions of these two reactions are based on MacDonald et al. and Heinrich Rapaport All other kinetic functions follow mass-action kinetics. The concentrations of transfer RNA species aa-tRNA and tRNA in the are kept while the other concentrations can change in the course of simulation. The model describes the translation of a short mRNA with codons. all reactions in the elongation cycle R28 and the corresponding species are replicated accordingly to model the species with ribosomes bound at different positions.

This model is described in the impaired degradation and immunization targeting of amyloid-beta dimers in a stochastic modelling approach. Proctor Pienaar Elson Kirkwood TB Molecular Neurodegeneration. disease is the most frequently diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder affecting with advanced age being the most prominent risk factor for developing AD. Despite intense research efforts aimed at elucidating the precise molecular underpinnings of a definitive answer is still lacking. In recent consensus has grown that dimerisation of the polypeptide amyloid-beta particularly plays a crucial role in the neuropathology that characterise AD-affected post-mortem including the large-scale accumulation of also referred to as senile plaques. This has led to the realistic hope that targeting Aß₄₂ immunotherapeutically could drastically reduce plaque burden in the ageing thus delaying AD onset or symptom progression. Stochastic modelling is a useful tool for increasing understanding of the processes underlying complex systems-affecting disorders such as providing a rapid and inexpensive strategy for testing putative new therapies. In light of the we developed computer simulation models to examine Aß₄₂ turnover and its aggregation in detail and to test the effect of immunization against Aß dimers. Our model demonstrates for the first time that even a slight decrease in the clearance rate of Aß₄₂ monomers is sufficient to increase the chance of dimers which could act as instigators of protofibril and fibril resulting in increased plaque levels. As the process is slow and levels of Aβ are normally stochastic effects are important. Our model predicts that reducing the rate of dimerisation leads to a significant reduction in plaque levels and delays onset of plaque formation. The model was used to test the effect of an antibody mediated immunological response. Our results showed that plaque levels were reduced compared to conditions where antibodies are not present. Our model supports the current thinking that levels of dimers are important in initiating the aggregation process. Although substantial knowledge exists regarding the no therapeutic intervention is on offer that reliably decreases disease burden in AD patients. Computer modelling could serve as one of a number tools to examine both the validity of reliable biomarkers and aid the discovery of successful intervention strategies.

This model is described in the Modeling intracellular dynamics of influenza virus replication to understand the control of viral RNA synthesis. Heldt Frensing Reichl U. J Virol. Influenza viruses transcribe and replicate their negative-sense RNA genome inside the nucleus of host cells via three viral RNA species. In the course of an these RNAs show distinct suggesting that differential regulation takes place. To investigate this regulation in a systematic we developed a mathematical model of influenza virus infection at the level of a single mammalian cell. It accounts for key steps of the viral life from virus entry to progeny virion while focusing in particular on the molecular mechanisms that control viral transcription and replication. We therefore explicitly consider the nuclear export of viral genome copies and a recent hypothesis proposing that replicative intermediates are stabilized by the viral polymerase complex and the nucleoprotein both mechanisms allow the model to capture a variety of published data sets at an unprecedented level of detail. Our findings provide theoretical support for an early regulation of replication by cRNA stabilization. they also suggest that the matrix protein controls viral RNA levels in the late phase of infection as part of its role during the nuclear export of viral genome copies. simulations show an accumulation of viral proteins and RNA toward the end of indicating that transport processes or budding limits virion release. our mathematical model provides an ideal platform for a systematic and quantitative evaluation of influenza virus replication and its complex regulation.

We have developed a model of insulin signalling in rodent adipocytes that includes both transcriptional feedback through the Forkhead box type O transcription and interaction with oxidative in addition to the core pathway. In the model Reactive Oxygen Species are both generated endogenously and can be applied externally. They regulate signalling though inhibition of phosphatases and induction of the activity Stress Activated Protein which themselves modulate feedbacks to insulin signalling and FOXO. Insulin oxidative stress combined produce a lower degree of activation insulin signalling than alone. Fasting and weak oxidative stress upregulate antioxidant defences while stronger oxidative stress leads to a short term activation of insulin signalling but if prolonged can have other effects including degradation of the insulin receptor substrate and FOXO. At high insulin the protective effect of moderate oxidative stress may disappear. Our model is consistent with a wide range of experimental some which is difficult to explain. Oxidative stress can have effects that are both up- and down-regulatory on insulin signalling.

Chaos Mesenchymal stem cells can give rise to bone and other tissue but their differentiation still escapes full control. In this paper we address this issue by mathematical modeling. We present a model for genetic switch determining the cell fate of progenitor cells which can differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes The model consists of two switch mechanisms and reproduces the experimentally observed three stable equilibrium a an and chondrogenic state. the loss of an intermediate state and the entailed attraction to one of two opposite states is modeled as a result of changing parameters. In our model in we achieve this by distributing the differentiation process to two functional switch parts acting in one triggering differentiation and the other determining cell fate. Via stability and bifurcation we investigate the effects of biochemical stimuli associated with different system inputs. We employ our model to generate differentiation scenarios on the single cell as well on the cell population level.

This model is described in the Kinetic modelling of phospholipid synthesis in Plasmodium knowlesi unravels crucial steps and relative importance of multiple pathways. Sen Vial Radulescu O. BMC Syst Biol Plasmodium is the causal parasite of infectious disease responsible for the death of up to one million people each year. Glycerophospholipid and consequently membrane biosynthesis are essential for the survival of parasite and are targeted by a new class of antimalarial drugs developed in our lab. In order to understand the highly redundant phospholipid synthethic pathways and eventual mechanism of resistance to various an organism specific kinetic model of these metabolic pathways need to be developed in Plasmodium species. Fluxomic data were used to build a quantitative kinetic model of glycerophospholipid pathways in Plasmodium knowlesi. In vitro incorporation dynamics of phospholipids unravels multiple synthetic pathways. A detailed metabolic network with values of the kinetic parameters rates and Michaelis has been built. In order to obtain a global search in the parameter we have designed a discrete and optimization method. Discrete parameters were used to sample the cone of admissible whereas the continuous Michaelis and maximum rates constants were obtained by local minimization of an objective function.The model was used to predict the distribution of fluxes within the network of various metabolic precursors.The quantitative analysis was used to understand eventual links between different pathways. The major source of phosphatidylcholine is the CDP-choline Kennedy pathway.In silico knock-out experiments showed comparable importance of phosphoethanolamine-N-methyltransferase and phosphatidylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase for PC synthesis.The flux values indicate major part of serine derived phosphatidylethanolamine is formed via serine whereas major part of phosphatidylserine is formed by base-exchange reactions.Sensitivity analysis of CDP-choline pathway shows that the carrier-mediated choline entry into the parasite and phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase reaction have the largest sensitivity coefficients in this but does not distinguish a reaction as an unique rate-limiting step. We provide a fully parametrized kinetic model for the multiple phospholipid synthetic pathways in P. knowlesi. This model has been used to clarify the relative importance of the various reactions in these metabolic pathways.

To use a novel computational approach to examine the molecular pathways involved in cartilage breakdown and to use computer simulation to test possible interventions to reduce collagen release. Methods. We constructed a computational model of the relevant molecular pathways using the Systems Biology Markup Language a computer-readable format of a biochemical network. The model was constructed using our experimental data showing that interleukin-1 and oncostatin M act synergistically to up-regulate collagenase protein and activity initiate cartilage collagen breakdown. Simulations were performed in the COPASI software package. Results. The model predicted that simulated inhibition of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or p38 mitogen-activated protein and over-expression of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases led to a reduction in collagen release. Over-expression of TIMP-1 was much less effective than TIMP-3 and led to a rather than in collagen release. Simulated interventions of receptor antagonists and inhibition of Janus kinase the first in OSM were ineffective. the model predicts that it is more effective to intervene at targets which are such as the JNK rather than close to the cytokine signal. In vitro experiments confirmed the effectiveness of JNK inhibition. Conclusion. Our study shows the value of computer modelling as a tool for examining possible interventions to reduce cartilage collagen breakdown.

Numerical simulations of two coupled cells demonstrate that such a scenario is indeed feasible.

Clin. Cancer Res. To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter data from patients treated with first-line and vincristine we formulated a model consisting of a system differential incorporating tumor-specific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in patients treated with first-line temozolomide chemotherapy and in patients treated with first-line radiotherapy. The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics in LGG patients treated with TMZ chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data. Using MTD we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describe LGG tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules.

To determine how a death ligand stimulus is effectively translated into caspase-8 we assessed this activity over time in single cells with compartmentalized probes that are cleaved by caspase-8 and used multiscale modeling to simultaneously describe single-cell and population data with an ensemble of single-cell models. We derived and experimentally validated a minimal model in which cleavage of caspase-8 in the enzymatic domain occurs in an interdimeric manner through interaction between whereas prodomain cleavage sites are cleaved in an intradimeric manner within DISCs. Modeling indicated that sustained membrane-bound caspase-8 activity is followed by transient cytosolic which can be interpreted as a molecular timer mechanism reflected by a limited lifetime of active caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 by combined intra- and interdimeric cleavage ensures weak signaling at low concentrations of CD95L and strongly accelerated activation at higher ligand thereby contributing to precise control of apoptosis.

The workflow integrates methods of miRNA target triplex structure molecular dynamics simulations and mathematical modeling for a reliable prediction of functional RNA triplexes and target repression efficiency.

Extensive measurements of protein aggregation kinetics have been but no consensus mechanism has emerged until now. This contribution aims at overcoming this gap by proposing a theoretically consistent crystallization-like model that is able to describe the classic types of amyloid fibrillization kinetics identified in our literature survey. Amyloid conversion represented as a function of time is shown to follow different curve ranging from sigmoidal to according the relative importance of the nucleation and growth steps. Using the apparently unrelated data are deconvoluted into generic mechanistic information integrating the combined influence of and fibril breakage events. It is notable that this complex assembly of interdependent events is ultimately reduced to a mathematically simple whose two parameters can be determined by little more than visual inspection.

Vázquez JA. BMC Pharmacol Toxicol The process of amyloid proteins aggregation causes several human neuropathologies. In some e.g. fibrillar deposits of the problems are generated in the processes of production and purification of protein and in the pump devices or injectable preparations for diabetics. Experimental kinetics and adequate modelling of chemical inhibition from amyloid aggregation are of practical importance in order to study the viable formulation and storage as well to predict and optimize the best conditions to reduce the effect of protein nucleation. In this experimental data of amyloid protein and apomyoglobin fibrillation from recent bibliography were selected to evaluate the capability of a bivariate sigmoid equation to model them. The mathematical functions combined with Weibull were used in reparameterized form and the effect of inhibitor concentrations on kinetic parameters from logistic equation were perfectly defined and explained. The surfaces of data were accurately described by proposed model and the presented analysis characterized the inhibitory influence on the protein aggregation by several chemicals. Discrimination between true and apparent inhibitors was also confirmed by the bivariate equation. EGCG for insulin at and taiwaniaflavone for were the compounds studied that shown the greatest inhibition capacity. An simple and effective model to investigate the inhibition of chemicals on amyloid protein aggregation has been developed.

Steckmann Awan Gerstman Chapagain PP. J. Theor. Biol. Amyloid fibrils are a common component in many debilitating human neurological diseases such as and in animal diseases such as BSE. The role of fibrillar proteins in AD has stimulated interest in the kinetics of fibril formation. Kinetic models that include reaction pathways and rate parameters for the various stages of the process can be helpful towards understanding the dynamics on a molecular level. Based upon experimental we have developed a mathematical model for the reaction pathways and determined rate parameters for peptide secondary structural conversion and aggregation during the entire fibrillogenesis process from random coil to mature including the molecular species that accelerate the conversions. The model and the rate parameters include different molecular structural stages in the nucleation and polymerization processes the numerical solutions yield graphs of concentrations different molecular species versus time that are in close agreement with experimental results. The model also allows for the calculation of time-dependent increase in aggregate size. The calculated results agree well with experimental and allow differences in experimental conditions to be included in the calculations. The specific steps of the model and rate constants that are determined by fitting to experimental data provide insight on the molecular species involved in the fibril formation process.

This model is described in the A one-hit model of cell death in inherited neuronal degenerations. Clarke Collins Leavitt Andrews Hayden Lumsden McInnes RR. Nature In genetic disorders associated with premature neuronal symptoms may not appear for years or decades. This delay in clinical onset is often assumed to reflect the occurrence of age-dependent cumulative damage. For it has been suggested that oxidative stress disrupts metabolism in neurological degenerative disorders by the cumulative damage of essential macromolecules. A prediction of the cumulative damage hypothesis is that the probability of cell death will increase over time. Here we show in contrast that the kinetics of neuronal death in models of photoreceptor hippocampal neurons undergoing excitotoxic cell a mouse model of cerebellar degeneration and diseases are all exponential and better explained by mathematical models in which the risk of cell death remains constant or decreases exponentially with age. These kinetics argue against the cumulative damage time of death any neuron is random. Our findings are most simply accommodated by a biochemical model in which mutation imposes a mutant steady state on the neuron and a single event randomly initiates cell death. This model appears to be common many forms of neurodegeneration and has implications for therapeutic strategies. This model is hosted on BioModels Database and identified BIOMD0000000538.

Cell Rep Cellular homeostasis is regulated by signals through multiple molecular networks that include protein phosphorylation and metabolites. where when the signal flows through a network and regulates homeostasis has not been explored. We have developed a reconstruction method for the signal flow based on time-course phosphoproteome and metabolome using multiple and have applied it to acute action of an important hormone for metabolic homeostasis. An insulin signal flows through a signaling pathways that involve protein phosphorylated metabolic and allosteric resulting in quantitative changes metabolites. Analysis of the network reveals that insulin induces phosphorylation and activation of liver-type phosphofructokinase thereby controlling a key reaction in glycolysis. We thus provide a versatile method of reconstruction signal flow through the network using phosphoproteome and metabolome data.

Miao Hollenbaugh Zand Holden-Wiltse Mosmann Perelson Wu Topham DJ. J. Virol. Seasonal and pandemic influenza A virus continues to be a public health threat. we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of the immune response kinetics to IAV infection and which biological parameters most strongly influence infection outcomes. To address these we use modeling approaches combined with experimental data to quantitatively investigate the innate and adaptive immune responses to primary IAV infection. Mathematical models were developed to describe the dynamic interactions between target influenza cytotoxic T lymphocytes and virus-specific IgG IgM. IAV and immune kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting models to a large data set obtained from primary H3N2 IAV infection of mice. Prior to a detectable virus-specific immune response day the estimated half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately and the half-life of free infectious IAV is approximately h. During the adaptive immune response day the average half-life of infected epithelial cells is approximately and the average half-life of free infectious virus is approximately min. During the adaptive model fitting confirms that CTLs are crucial for limiting infected while virus-specific IgM regulates free IAV levels. This may imply that CD4 T cells and class-switched IgG antibodies are more relevant for generating IAV-specific memory and preventing future infection via a more rapid secondary immune response. simulation studies were performed to understand the relative contributions of biological parameters to IAV clearance.

Arsenic has a dual role as causative and curative agent of human disease. there is considerable interest in elucidating arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms. By an ensemble modelling we identified a best parsimonious mathematical model which recapitulates and predicts intracellular arsenic dynamics for different conditions and thereby providing novel insights into arsenic toxicity and detoxification mechanisms in which could partly be confirmed experimentally by dedicated experiments. our analyses suggest arsenic is mainly protein-bound during short-term whereas glutathione-conjugated arsenic dominates during long-term arsenic is not stably but can leave the vacuole via an export and Fps1 is controlled by Hog1-dependent and Hog1-independent mechanisms during arsenite stress. Our results challenge glutathione depletion as a key mechanism for arsenic toxicity and instead suggest that increased glutathione biosynthesis protects the proteome against damaging effects of arsenic and that widespread protein inactivation contributes to the toxicity of this metalloid.

In the presence of excess proteasomes the cell easily maintains homeostasis. when the ratio between available proteasome and the alphaSN protofilaments is reduced below a threshold we predict a collapse of homeostasis and onset of oscillations in the proteasome concentration.

In concentration in the plasma exhibited an unexpected overshoot to as high of the predrug and this overshoot persisted as late hours post-drug ingestion.

We present a hypothesis for the loss of acetylcholine in disease that is based on two recent experimental that beta-amyloid causes leakage of choline across cell membranes and that decreased production of acetylcholine increases the production of beta-amyloid. According to the an increase in beta-amyloid concentration caused by proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein results in an increase the leakage of choline out cells. This leads to a reduction in intracellular choline concentration and hence a reduction in acetylcholine production. The reduction in acetylcholine causes an increase in the concentration of beta-amyloid. The resultant positive feedback between decreased acetylcholine and increased beta-amyloid accelerates the loss of acetylcholine. We compare the predictions of choline-leakage hypothesis with a number of experimental observations. We also approximate it with a pair of ordinary differential equations.

The overall process of protein aggregation is characterized by initial lag time during which no detectable aggregation occurs in the solution and by maximal aggregation rate at which the dissolved protein converts into aggregates. In this the correlation between lag time and the maximal rate of protein aggregation is analyzed. It found that the product of these two quantities depends on a single numerical the kinetic index of the curve quantifying time evolution of the fraction protein aggregated.

A mechanistic understanding of the rise remains elusive. a minimal mathematical model has been developed that quantitatively describes the dynamics in cell lines that exhibit the rise as well in cell lines that do not. The model includes steps of APP processing through both the so-called amyloidogenic pathway and the so-called non-amyloidogenic pathway. It is shown that the cross-talk between these two pathways accounts for the increase in production response to i.e. an increase in C99 will inhibit the non-amyloidogenic redirecting APP to be cleaved by leading to an additional increase in C99 that overcomes the loss in activity.

Based on this and other data from the a computer simulation model was built using the Systems Biology Markup Language using an iterative approach of data analysis and modelling. Individual parameters were subsequently altered to assess their effect on the model. A progressive loss of cartilage matrix occurred with age. MMP-13 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase staining in cartilage increased with age a concomitant decrease in LC-3B and Bcl-2. Stochastic simulations from the computational model showed a good agreement with these once transforming growth signalling via receptors was included. Oxidative stress and the interleukin pathway were identified as key factors in driving the cartilage breakdown associated with ageing. A progressive loss of cartilage matrix and cellularity occurs with age. This is accompanied with increased levels of oxidative apoptosis and MMP-13 a decrease in chondrocyte autophagy.

To the compounds that affect the nucleation growth steps we call true inhibitors. An apparent inhibition mechanism may however result from the alteration of thermodynamic properties such as the solubility of amyloidogenic protein. Apparent inhibitors markedly influence protein aggregation kinetics measured in yet they are likely to lead disappointing results when tested in vivo.

Several clock genes have been implicated in the temperature-dependent control of period in Arabidopsis.

Our data demonstrate that two cryptochrome photoreceptors differentially control circadian period and sustain rhythmicity across the physiological temperature range.

Here we report that the master immune regulator NPR1 of pathogenesis-related gene Arabidopsis is a sensor of the redox state and regulates transcription of core circadian clock genes even in the absence of pathogen challenge. acute perturbation in the redox status triggered by the immune signal salicylic acid does not compromise the circadian clock but rather leads to its reinforcement. Mathematical modelling and subsequent experiments show that NPR1 reinforces the circadian clock without changing the period by regulating both the morning and evening clock genes. This balanced network architecture helps plants gate their immune responses towards the morning and minimize costs on growth at night. Our study demonstrates how a sensitive redox rhythm interacts with a robust circadian clock to ensure proper responsiveness to environmental stimuli without compromising fitness of the organism.

Mammalian target of rapamycin kinase responds to growth nutrients and cellular energy status and is a central controller of cellular growth. mTOR exists in two multiprotein complexes that are embedded into a complex signalling network. Adenosine monophosphate-dependent kinase is activated by energy deprivation and shuts off adenosine anabolic in part via the inactivation of mTORC1. we observed that AMPK not only responds to energy deprivation but can also be activated by and is further induced in mTORC1-deficient cells. We have recently modelled the mTOR covering both complexes and their insulin nutrient inputs. In the present study we extended the network by an AMPK module to generate the date most comprehensive data-driven dynamic AMPK-mTOR network model. In order to define the intersection via which AMPK is activated by the insulin we compared simulations for six different hypothetical model structures to our observed AMPK dynamics. Hypotheses ranking suggested that the most probable intersection between insulin and AMPK was the insulin receptor substrate and that the effects of canonical IRS downstream cues on AMPK would be mediated via an mTORC1-driven negative-feedback loop. We tested these predictions experimentally in multiple where we inhibited or induced players along the insulin-mTORC1 signalling axis and observed AMPK induction or inhibition.

To unravel the intrinsic challenges of understanding such a highly networked we have taken a systems biology approach to cellular senescence. We report a detailed analysis of senescence signalling via DNA FoxO3a transcription oxidative stress mitochondrial regulation and mitophagy. We show in silico and vitro that inhibition of reactive oxygen species can prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane whilst inhibition of mTOR shows a partial rescue of mitochondrial mass changes during establishment of senescence. Dual inhibition of ROS and mTOR in vitro confirmed computational model predictions that it was possible to further reduce senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA double-strand breaks. these interventions were unable to abrogate the senescence-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and we identified decreased mitochondrial fission as the potential driving force for increased mitochondrial mass via prevention of mitophagy. Dynamic sensitivity analysis of the model showed network stabilised at a new late state of cellular senescence.

To better understand the dynamics of mucosal immunity during C. difficile infection from initiation through expansion to we built a computational model of the mucosal immune response to the bacterium.

In the production of anti-microbial peptides by inflamed epithelial cells and activated neutrophils in response to C. difficile infection inhibit the re-growth of beneficial commensal bacterial species.

The case presented investigates interferon-gamma induced STAT1 signalling in two cell types that play a key role in pancreatic cancer stellate and cells. IFNγ inhibits the growth for both types of cells and may be prototypic of agents that simultaneously hit cancer and stroma cells. We combined time-course experiments with mathematical modelling to focus on the common situation in which variations between profiles of experimental time from different cell are observed. To understand how biochemical reactions are causing the observed we performed a parameter identifiability analysis. We successfully identified reactions that differ in pancreatic stellate cells and cancer by comparing confidence intervals of parameter value estimates and the variability of model trajectories. Our analysis shows that useful information can also be obtained from nonidentifiable parameters.

An alternative approach is to construct a mathematical model of the system and via sensitivity analysis rank order the targets in known with respect to an endpoint such as the diphosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase concentration in the nucleus. Using published a model was created via sensitivity it was concluded after NGF tropomyosin receptor kinase A was one of the most sensitive druggable targets. This initial model was subsequently used to develop a further model incorporating physiological and pharmacological parameters. This allowed the exploration of characteristics required for a successful hypothetical TrkA inhibitor. Using these systems we were able to identify candidates for the optimal drug targets in the known pathway. These conclusions were consistent with clinical and human genetic data. We also found that incorporating appropriate physiological context was essential to drawing accurate conclusions about important parameters such as the drug dose required to give pathway inhibition. the importance of concentration key reactants such as TrkA kinase means that appropriate contextual data are required before clear conclusions can be drawn.

This model is described in the Plasticity of TGF-β signaling Cellière Fengos Hervé Iber D. BMC Syst Biol. Nov The family of TGF-β ligands is large and its members are involved in many different signaling processes. These processes strongly differ in type with TGF-β ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members of the TGF-β family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then be expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand concentration. A number of different models have been proposed to reconcile these different behaviours. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications that are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGF-β signaling network. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the core of TGF-β signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we identified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give rise to or oscillatory responses to constant as well those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to time-varying ligand concentrations expected in the read-out of A combination a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus biases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained while oscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the turn-over of I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient receptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding. We find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the response type. The intensity of a constant signal the ligand on other affected only the strength but not the type of response. The architecture of the TGF-β pathway enables the observed signaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGF-β ligand in different cell types and under different conditions can be explained with differences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective rate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.

Stavrum Heiland Schuster Puntervoll Ziegler M. J. Biol. Chem. Tryptophan is utilized in various metabolic routes including protein and melatonin synthesis the kynurenine pathway. Perturbations in these pathways have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Here we present a comprehensive kinetic model of the complex network of human tryptophan metabolism based upon existing kinetic data for all enzymatic conversions and transporters. By integrating tissue-specific expression modeling tryptophan metabolism in liver and brain returned intermediate metabolite concentrations in the physiological range. Sensitivity and metabolic control analyses identified expected key enzymes to govern fluxes in the branches of network. Combining tissue-specific models revealed a considerable impact of the kynurenine pathway in liver on the concentrations of neuroactive derivatives in the brain. using expression data from a cancer study predicted metabolite changes that resembled the experimental observations. We conclude that the combination of kinetic model with expression data represents a powerful diagnostic tool to predict alterations in tryptophan metabolism. The model is readily scalable to include more thereby enabling assessment of organismal tryptophan metabolism in health and disease.

Palsson Hickling Bradshaw-Pierce Zager Jooss Spilker Palsson Vicini P. BMC Syst Biol. Sep The complexity and multiscale nature of the mammalian immune response provides an excellent test bed for the potential of mathematical modeling and simulation to facilitate mechanistic understanding. mathematical models of the immune response focused on subsets of the immune system specific aspects of the response. Mathematical models have been developed for the humoral side of the immune or for the cellular or for cytokine but rarely have they been proposed to encompass the overall system complexity. We propose here a framework for integration of subset based on a system biology approach. A dynamic the Fully-integrated Immune Response Model was built in a stepwise fashion by integrating published subset models and adding novel features. The approach used to build the model includes formulation of the network interacting species and the subsequent introduction of rate laws to describe each biological process. The resulting model represents a multi-organ comprised of the target organ where the immune response takes circulating lymphoid and B tissue. The cell types accounted for include a few T-cell lineages helper and B-cell activation to plasma cells. Four different cytokines were accounted IL-10 and IL-12. In generic inflammatory signals are used to represent the kinetics of and TGF-β. Cell apoptosis and migration are described as appropriate for the different cell types. The model is a hybrid structure containing information from several mammalian species. The structure of the network was built to be physiologically and biochemically consistent. Rate laws for all the cellular fate growth factor production rates and together with antibody production rates and are provided. The results demonstrate how this framework can be used to integrate mathematical models of the immune response from several published sources and describe qualitative predictions of global immune system response arising from the hybrid model.

Petelenz-Kurdziel Kuehn Nordlander Klein Hong Jacobson Dahl Schaber Nielsen Hohmann Klipp E. PLoS Comput. Biol. e1003084 We provide an integrated dynamic view on a eukaryotic osmolyte linking signaling with regulation of gene metabolic control and growth. Adaptation to osmotic changes enables cells to adjust cellular activity and turgor pressure to an altered environment. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae adapts to hyperosmotic stress by activating the HOG signaling which controls glycerol accumulation. The Hog1 kinase stimulates transcription of genes encoding enzymes required for glycerol production and import activates a regulatory enzyme in glycolysis In glycerol outflow is prevented by closure of the Fps1 glycerol facilitator. In order to better understand the contributions to glycerol accumulation of these different mechanisms and how redox energy metabolism as well biomass production are maintained under such conditions we collected an extensive dataset. Over a period of min after hyperosmotic shock we monitored in wild type and different mutant cells the concentrations of key metabolites and proteins relevant for osmoadaptation. The dataset was used to parameterize an ODE model that reproduces the generated data very well. A detailed computational analysis using time-dependent response coefficients showed that contributes to rerouting glycolytic flux towards lower glycolysis. The transient growth arrest following hyperosmotic shock further adds to redirecting almost all glycolytic flux from biomass towards glycerol production. Osmoadaptation is robust to loss of individual adaptation pathways because of the existence and upregulation of alternative routes glycerol accumulation. For the Stl1 glycerol importer contributes to glycerol accumulation in a mutant with diminished glycerol production capacity. In our observations suggest a role for trehalose accumulation in osmoadaptation and that Hog1 probably directly contributes to the regulation of Fps1 glycerol facilitator.

On the other a local beta-sheet form as viewed from Gly10 and both beta-sheet random coil as viewed from Ala26 and Ala31 were detected in the fibril at pH The results indicate that conformational transitions from alpha-helix to and from random coil to beta-sheet forms occurred in the central and C-terminus during the fibril formation. The increased 13C resonance intensities of fibrils after a certain delay time suggests that the fibrillation can be explained by a two-step reaction mechanism in which the first step is a homogeneous association to form a and the second step is an autocatalytic heterogeneous fibrillation. In contrast to the fibril at pH the fibril at pH formed a local beta-sheet conformation at the central region and exhibited a random coil at the C-terminus region. Not only a hydrophobic interaction among the amphiphilic but also an electrostatic interaction between charged side chains can play an important role for the fibril formation at pH and acting as electrostatically favorable and unfavorable respectively.

This model is described in the The resolution of a mathematical model of neutrophil and macrophage interactions. Dunster Byrne King JR. Bull. Math. Biol. There is growing interest in inflammation due to its involvement in many diverse medical including arthritis and asthma. The traditional view that resolution of inflammation is a passive process is now being superceded by an alternative hypothesis whereby its resolution is an anti-inflammatory process that can be manipulated therapeutically. This shift in mindset has stimulated a resurgence of interest in the biological mechanisms by which inflammation resolves. The anti-inflammatory processes central to the resolution of inflammation revolve around macrophages and are closely related to pro-inflammatory processes mediated by neutrophils and their ability to damage healthy tissue. We develop a spatially averaged model of inflammation centring on its accounting for populations of neutrophils and macrophages incorporating both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes. Our ordinary differential equation model exhibits two outcomes that we relate to healthy and unhealthy states. We use bifurcation analysis to investigate how variation in the system parameters affects its outcome. We find that therapeutic manipulation of the rate macrophage phagocytosis can aid in resolving inflammation but success is critically dependent on the rate of neutrophil apoptosis.

The over complication of inhibitory models stems from the common use of the inhibitory term an equilibrium binding term that does not distinguish between inhibitor binding and inhibitory effect. Since its initial appearance in the around a century the perceived mechanistic methods used in its production have spurred countless inhibitory equations. These equations are overly complex and are seldom compared to each which has destroyed their usefulness resulting in the proliferation and regulatory acceptance of simpler models such as IC50s for drug characterization. empirical analysis of inhibitory data recognizing the clear distinctions between inhibitor binding and inhibitory effect can produce simple logical inhibition models.

Deregulation of the pathway due to alterations affecting the expression or function of a number pathway components has long been associated with numerous forms of cancer. Under normal Epidermal Growth Factor stimulates a rapid but transient activation of ERK as the signal is rapidly shutdown. under cancerous mutation conditions the ERK signal cannot be shutdown and is sustained resulting in the constitutive activation of ERK and continual cell proliferation. In this we have used computational modelling techniques to investigate what effects various cancerous alterations have on the signalling flow through the ERK pathway.We have generated a new model of the EGFR activated ERK which was verified by our own experimental data. We then altered our model to represent various cancerous situations such as B-Raf and EGFR as well overexpression. Analysis of the models showed that different cancerous situations resulted in different signalling patterns through the ERK especially when compared to the normal EGF signal pattern. Our model predicts that cancerous EGFR mutation and overexpression signals almost exclusively via the Rap1 predicting that this pathway is the best target for drugs. our model also highlights the importance of receptor degradation in normal and cancerous EGFR suggests that receptor degradation is a key difference between the signalling from EGF and Nerve Growth Factor receptors.Our results suggest that different routes to ERK activation are being utilised in different cancerous situations which therefore has interesting implications for drug selection strategies. We also conducted a comparison of the critical differences between signalling from different growth factor receptors mutated and with our results suggesting the difference between systems are large scale and can be attributed to the of entire pathways rather than subtle difference in individual rate constants between the systems.

PLoS ONE e0162428 We describe a liver-centric in silico modeling framework for acetaminophen pharmacology and metabolism. We focus on a computational model to characterize whole body uptake and liver transport phase I and II metabolism. We do this by incorporating sub-models that span three Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic modeling of acetaminophen uptake and distribution at the whole body cell and blood flow modeling at the level and metabolism at the sub-cellular level. We have used standard modeling modalities at each of the three scales. In we have used the Systems Biology Markup Language to create both the whole-body and sub-cellular scales. Our modeling approach allows us to run the individual sub-models separately and allows us to easily exchange models at a particular scale without the need to extensively rework the sub-models at other scales.

Leber Abedi Hontecillas Viladomiu Hoops Ciupe Caughman Andrew Bassaganya-Riera J. Theor. Biol. T follicular helper cells are a highly plastic subset of T cells specialized in providing B cell help and promoting inflammatory effector responses during infectious and immune-mediate diseases. Helicobacter pylori is the dominant member of the gastric microbiota and exerts both beneficial and harmful effects on the host. Chronic inflammation in the context of H. pylori has been linked to an upregulation in T helper and Th17 T cell controlled in part by the interleukin-21. This study investigates the differentiation and regulation of Tfh major producers of in the immune response to H. pylori challenge. To better understand the conditions influencing promotion and inhibition of a chronically elevated Tfh we used top-down and bottom-up approaches to develop computational models of Tfh and T follicular regulatory cell differentiation. Stability analysis was used to characterize the presence of two bi-stable steady states in the calibrated models. Stochastic simulation was used to illustrate the ability of parameter set to dictate two distinct behavioral patterns. sensitivity analysis helped identify the importance of various parameters on the establishment of Tfh and Tfr cell populations. The core network model was expanded into a more comprehensive and predictive model by including cytokine production and signaling pathways. From the expanded interaction between TGFB-Induced Factor Homeobox and the retinoid X receptor was displayed to exert control over the determination of Tfh response. Model simulations predict that Tgif1 and RXR respectively induce and curtail Tfh responses. This computational hypothesis was validated experimentally by assaying RXR and Tfh in stomachs of mice infected with H. pylori. The impulse of RXR as shown in the paper can be implemented by creating an event in the curated SBML file. This model is hosted on BioModels Database and identified BIOMD0000000625.

Ray Su Ye P. BMC Syst Biol. May Meiosis is the sexual reproduction process common to eukaryotes. The diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes meiosis in sporulation medium to form four haploid spores. Initiation of the process is tightly controlled by intricate networks of positive and negative feedback loops. expression of early meiotic proteins occurs within a narrow time window. sporulation efficiency is strikingly different for yeast strains with distinct mutations or genetic backgrounds. To investigate signal transduction pathways that regulate transient protein expression and sporulation we develop a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations. The model describes early meiotic particularly feedback mechanisms at the system level and phosphorylation of signaling molecules for regulating protein activities. The mathematical model is capable of simulating the orderly and transient dynamics of meiotic proteins including the master regulator of meiotic and a kinase encoded by an early gene. The model is validated by quantitative sporulation phenotypes of single-gene knockouts. we can use the model to make novel predictions on the cooperation between proteins in the signaling pathway. Virtual perturbations on feedback loops suggest that both positive and negative feedback loops are required to terminate expression of early meiotic proteins. Bifurcation analyses on feedback loops indicate that multiple feedback loops are coordinated to modulate sporulation efficiency. In positive auto-regulation of Ime2 produces a bistable system with a normal meiotic state and a more efficient meiotic state. By systematically scanning through feedback loops in the mathematical we demonstrate in the decisions to terminate protein expression and to sporulate at different efficiencies stem from feedback signals toward the master regulator Ime1 and the early meiotic protein Ime2. We argue that the architecture of meiotic initiation pathway generates a robust mechanism that assures a rapid and complete transition into meiosis. This type of systems-level regulation is a commonly used mechanism controlling developmental programs in yeast and other organisms. Our mathematical model uncovers key regulations that can be manipulated to enhance sporulation an important first step in the development of new strategies for producing gametes with high quality and quantity.

To understand how calcium selectively stimulates two opposing we developed a detailed computational model and performed simulations with different calcium input and durations. We show that with a total amount of calcium ions kept high frequencies of calcium pulses stimulate calmodulin more efficiently. Calcium input activates both calcineurin and protein kinase II at all but increased frequencies shift the relative activation from calcineurin to CaMKII. Irrespective of amplitude and duration of the total amount of calcium ions injected adjusts the sensitivity of system to calcium input frequencies. At a given the quantity of CaMKII activated is proportional to the total amount of calcium. an input of a small amount of calcium at high frequencies can induce the same activation of CaMKII as a larger at lower frequencies. the extent of activation CaMKII signals with high calcium frequency is further controlled by other including the availability of and by the potency of phosphatase inhibitors.

To a number of crystal structures natural and synthetic ligands complexed to their target proteins have been providing molecular level snap-shots of ligand binding. a deeper understanding of receptor and ligand flexibility conformational freedom is required to develop stable and effective ATRA analogues for clinical use. we have used molecular modelling techniques to define RAR interactions with ATRA and two synthetic EC19 and compared their predicted biochemical activities to experimental measurements of relative ligand affinity and recruitment of coactivator proteins. A comprehensive molecular docking approach that explored the conformational space of the ligands indicated that ATRA is able to bind the three RAR proteins in a number of conformations with one extended structure being favoured. In contrast the biologically-distinct 9-cis-retinoic acid showed significantly less conformational flexibility in the RAR binding pockets. These findings were used to inform docking studies of the synthetic retinoids EC23 and their respective methyl esters. EC23 was found to be an excellent mimic for and occupied similar binding modes to ATRA in all three target RAR proteins. In EC19 exhibited an alternative binding mode which reduces the strength of key polar interactions in but is well-suited to the larger RARÎ² binding pocket. In docking of the corresponding esters revealed the loss of key polar interactions which may explain the much reduced biological activity. Our computational results were complemented using an in vitro binding assay based on FRET which showed that EC23 was a strongly pan-agonist of the while EC19 exhibited specificity for as predicted by the docking studies.

Plasmin and urokinase-type plasminogen activator are ubiquitous proteases that regulate the extracellular environment. Although they are secreted in inactive they can activate each other through proteolytic cleavage. This mutual interplay creates the potential for complex which we investigated using mathematical modeling and in vitro experiments. We constructed ordinary differential equations to model the conversion of precursor plasminogen into active and precursor urokinase into active Although neither PLS nor UPA exhibits allosteric modeling showed that cooperativity occurred at the system level because of substrate competition. Computational simulations and bifurcation analysis predicted that the system would be bistable over a range of parameters for cooperativity and positive feedback. Cell-free experiments with recombinant proteins tested key predictions of the model. PLS activation in response to scUPA stimulus was found to be cooperative in vitro. bistability was demonstrated in vitro by the presence of two significantly different steady-state levels of PLS activation for the same levels of stimulus. We conclude that bistable activation of UPA-PLS is possible in the presence of substrate competition.

Aging Excessive DNA damage can induce an irreversible cell cycle called which is generally perceived as an important tumour-suppressor mechanism. it is unclear how cells decide whether to senesce or not after DNA damage. By combining experimental data with a parameterized mathematical model we elucidate this cell fate decision at the G1-S transition. Our model provides a quantitative and conceptually new understanding of how human fibroblasts decide whether DNA damage is beyond repair and senesce. Model data imply that the G1-S transition is regulated by a bistable hysteresis switch with respect to Cdk2 which in turn is controlled by the ratio rather than cyclin abundance. We experimentally confirm the resulting predictions that to induce senescence in healthy cells both high initial and elevated background DNA damage are necessary and in already damaged cells much lower additional DNA damage is sufficient. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of how noise in protein abundances allows cells to overcome the G1-S arrest even with substantial DNA potentially leading to and how accumulating DNA damage with age increasingly sensitizes cells for senescence.

Bulik Holzhütter Berndt N. BMC Biol. Adaptation of the cellular metabolism to varying external conditions is brought about by regulated changes in the activity of enzymes and transporters. Hormone-dependent reversible enzyme phosphorylation and concentration changes of reactants and allosteric effectors are the major types of rapid kinetic enzyme whereas on longer time scales changes in protein abundance may also become operative. we used a comprehensive mathematical model of the hepatic glucose metabolism of rat hepatocytes to decipher the relative importance of different regulatory modes and their mutual interdependencies in the hepatic control of plasma glucose homeostasis.Model simulations reveal significant differences in the capability of liver metabolism to counteract variations of plasma glucose in different physiological settings ad libitum nutrient Changes in enzyme abundances adjust the metabolic output to the anticipated physiological demand but may turn into a regulatory disadvantage if sudden unexpected changes of the external conditions occur. Allosteric and hormonal control of enzyme activities allow the liver to assume a broad range of metabolic states and may even fully reverse flux changes resulting from of enzyme abundances alone. Metabolic control analysis reveals that control of the hepatic glucose metabolism is mainly exerted by enzymes which are differently controlled by alterations in enzyme reversible and allosteric effects.In hepatic glucose regulation of enzyme activities by changes of allosteric and reversible phosphorylation is equally important as changes in protein abundance of key regulatory enzymes.

Front Microbiol Tetrahydrofolate and its one-carbon collectively termed are essential but inherently unstable. While it is clear that chemical oxidation can cleave folates or damage their pterin very little is known about enzymatic damage to these molecules or about whether the folate biosynthesis pathway responds adaptively to damage its end-products. The presence of a duplication the gene encoding folate biosynthesis enzyme pyrophosphokinase in many sequenced bacterial genomes combined with a strong chromosomal clustering of the folK gene with encoding the enzyme ketopantoate led us to infer that PanB has a side activity that cleaves yielding a pterin product that is recycled by FolK. Genetic and metabolic analyses of Escherichia coli strains showed that overexpression of PanB leads to accumulation of the likely folate cleavage product 6-hydroxymethylpterin and other pterins in cells and and-unexpectedly-to a increase in total folate content. In silico modeling of the folate biosynthesis pathway showed that these observations are consistent with the in vivo cleavage of by a side-activity of with FolK-mediated recycling of the pterin cleavage and with regulation of folate biosynthesis by folates or their damage products.

To delineate aa-stimulated mTOR network we here combine a computational-experimental approach with text mining-enhanced quantitative proteomics. We report that AMP-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and mTOR complex are acutely activated by aa-readdition in an mTORC1-independent manner. AMPK activation by aa is mediated by protein kinase In AMPK impinges on the autophagy regulators Unc-51-like kinase-1 and c-Jun. AMPK is widely recognized as an mTORC1 antagonist that is activated by starvation. We find that aa acutely activate AMPK concurrently with mTOR. We show that AMPK under aa sufficiency acts to sustain autophagy. This may be required to maintain protein homoeostasis and deliver metabolite intermediates for biosynthetic processes.

It is the result of a consensus merger of two previous reconstructions. Technical The compartments included here have no volume there are no reliable estimates available for those volumes yet. There are no kinetic functions defined for the reactions because this model only represents the chemical structure of the network All reactions are marked reversible because all chemical reactions are reversible. The model is described in the article and available as supplementary A consensus yeast metabolic network reconstruction obtained from a community approach to systems biology. Herrgård Swainston N et al. Nat Biotechnol. Genomic data allow the large-scale manual or semi-automated assembly of metabolic network which provide highly curated organism-specific knowledge bases. Although several genome-scale network reconstructions describe Saccharomyces cerevisiae they differ in scope and use different terminologies to describe the same chemical entities. This makes comparisons between them difficult and underscores the desirability of a consolidated metabolic network that collects and formalizes the of yeast metabolism. We describe how we have produced a consensus metabolic network reconstruction for S. cerevisiae. In drafting we placed special emphasis on referencing molecules to persistent databases or using database-independent such as SMILES or InChI as this permits their chemical structure to be represented unambiguously and in a manner that permits automated reasoning. The reconstruction is readily available via a publicly accessible database and in the Systems Biology Markup Language It can be maintained as a resource that serves as a common denominator for studying the systems biology of yeast. Similar strategies should benefit communities studying genome-scale metabolic networks of other organisms.

Am J Physiol Heart Circ The experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. In this article we introduce a mathematical model of the action potential of human ventricular cells while including a high level of electrophysiological is computationally cost-effective enough to be applied in large-scale spatial simulations for the study of reentrant arrhythmias. The model is based on recent experimental data on most of the major ionic fast L-type transient rapid and slow delayed inward rectifier currents. The model includes a basic calcium allowing for the realistic modeling of calcium current and the contraction staircase. We are able to reproduce human and M cell action potentials and show that differences can be explained by differences in the transient outward and slow delayed rectifier currents. Our model reproduces the experimentally observed data on action potential duration which is an important characteristic for reentrant arrhythmias. The conduction velocity restitution of our model is broader than in other models and agrees better with available data. we model the dynamics of spiral wave rotation in a two-dimensional sheet of human ventricular tissue and show that the spiral wave follows a complex meandering pattern and has a period of ms. We conclude that the proposed model reproduces a variety of electrophysiological behaviors and provides a basis for studies of reentrant arrhythmias in human ventricular tissue.

USA The based on the intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the and Clock can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in conditions of continuous darkness. These limit cycle oscillations correspond to circadian rhythms autonomously generated by suprachiasmatic nuclei and by some peripheral tissues. By using different sets of parameter values producing circadian we compare the effect of various parameters and show that both the occurrence and period of the oscillations are generally most sensitive to parameters related synthesis or degradation of Bmal1 mRNA and BMAL1 protein. The mechanism of circadian oscillations relies on the formation of an inactive complex between PER and CRY the activators CLOCK and BMAL1 that enhance Per and Cry expression. Bifurcation diagrams and computer simulations nevertheless indicate the possible existence of a second source of oscillatory behavior. sustained oscillations might arise from the sole negative autoregulation of Bmal1 expression. This second oscillatory mechanism may not be functional in physiological and its period need not necessarily be circadian. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark cycles. Long-term suppression of circadian oscillations by a single light pulse can occur in the model when a stable steady state coexists with a stable limit cycle. The phase of the oscillations upon entrainment in LD critically depends on the parameters that govern the level of CRY protein. Small changes in the parameters governing CRY levels can shift the peak in Per mRNA from the L to D or can prevent entrainment. The results are discussed in relation to physiological disorders of the sleep-wake cycle linked to perturbations of the human circadian such as the familial advanced sleep phase syndrome or the non-24h sleep-wake syndrome.

Hilgemann Noble D. Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci Mar Interactions of electrogenic sodium-calcium calcium channel and sarcoplasmic reticulum in the mammalian heart have been explored by simulation of extracellular calcium transients measured with tetramethylmurexide in rabbit atrium. The approach has been to use the simplest possible formulations of these which together with a minimum number of additional mechanisms allow reconstruction of action intracellular calcium transients and extracellular calcium transients. A sodium-calcium exchange stoichiometry is assumed. Calcium-channel inactivation is assumed to take place by a voltage-dependent which is accelerated by a rise in intracellular calcium release becomes a major physiological regulator of calcium influx via channels. A calcium release mechanism is which both calcium- and which undergoes prolonged inactivation. microM cytosolic calcium buffer is assumed. For most simulations only instantaneous potassium conductances are simulated so as to study the other mechanisms independently of time- and calcium-dependent outward current. the model reconstructs extracellular calcium transients and typical action-potential configuration changes during steady-state and non-steady-state stimulation from the mechanisms directly involved in trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements. The model predicts relatively small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation mumol kg-1 fresh mass per calcium current is fully activated within ms of inactivation is substantially complete within and sodium-calcium exchange significantly resists repolarization from approximately mV. Net calcium movements many times larger are possible during non-steady-state stimulation. Long action potentials at premature excitations or after inhibition of calcium release can be supported almost exclusively by calcium current influx mumol kg-1 fresh action potentials during potentiated post-stimulatory contractions can be supported almost exclusively by sodium-calcium exchange calcium efflux mumol kg-1 fresh Large calcium movements between the extracellular space and the sarcoplasmic reticulum can take place through the cytosol with virtually no contractile activation.

A somewhat unique feature of hGH action is its homodimerization of two hGH which is required for intracellular signaling and stimulation of cell yet the potencies of hGH mutants in cell-based assays rarely correlate with their overall receptor-binding avidities. a mathematical model of hGH-stimulated cell signaling is accounting not only for binding interactions at the cell surface but induction of receptor endocytosis and downregulation as well.

Rate half and receptor affinities were assigned values derived from the experimental literature. At its current level of development the model is able to accurately simulate the magnitude and decay of the ACTH and cortisol concentration peaks resulting from the ovine-CRH stimulation test in normal and hypercortisolemic patients. The model will be used to predict the effects of lesions in different components of the HPA axis on the time course of cortisol and ACTH levels.

Here we present the first theoretical model of the biochemical network describing the proteolysis of collagen I by matrix metalloproteinases and membrane type matrix metalloproteinases in the presence of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases in a well stirred environment. The model can serve as a tool for describing quantitatively the activation of MMP2 proenzyme the ectodomain shedding of and the collagenolysis arising from both of the enzymes. We show that pro-MMP2 a process that involves a trimer formation of the proenzyme with TIMP2 and is suppressed at high inhibitor levels and paradoxically attains maximum only at intermediate TIMP2 concentrations. We also calculate the conditions for which pro-MMP2 activation is maximal. Furthermore we demonstrate that the ectodomain shedding of MT1-MMP can serve as a mechanism controlling the MT1-MMP availability and therefore the pro-MMP2 activation. Finally the proteolytic synergism of MMP2 and MT1-MMP is introduced and described quantitatively. The model provides us a tool to determine the conditions under which the synergism is optimized. Our approach is the first step toward a more complete description of the proteolytic processes that occur in the extracellular matrix and include a wider spectrum of enzymes and substrates as well naturally occurring or artificial inhibitors.

Math Biosci Recent experimental data have shown that HIV-specific CD4 T cells provide a very important target for HIV replication. We use mathematical models to explore the effect of specific CD4 T cell infection on the dynamics of virus spread and immune responses. Infected CD4 T cells can provide antigen for their own stimulation. We show that such autocatalytic cell division can significantly enhance virus and can also provide an additional reservoir for virus persistence during anti-viral drug therapy. In the initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells is an important determinant of acute infection dynamics. A high initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a sudden and fast drop of the population HIV-specific CD4 T cells which results quickly in their extinction. On the other a low initial number of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can lead to a prolonged persistence of HIV-specific CD4 T cell help at higher levels. The model suggests that boosting the population of HIV-specific CD4 T cells can increase the amount of virus-induced immune lead to less efficient anti-viral effector and thus speed up disease especially if effector responses such as CTL have not been sufficiently boosted at the same time.

METHODS AND We implemented a variety of one-dimensional sinoatrial models consisting of descriptions and peripheral sinoatrial node as well rabbit or human atrial cells. These one-dimensional models were implemented using CMISS on an SGI Origin supercomputer. Intercellular coupling parameters recorded in experimental studies on sinoatrial node and atrial cell-pairs under-represent the electrotonic interactions that any cardiomyocyte would have in a multidimensional setting. cell-to-cell coupling had to be scaled-up a factor of in order to obtain a stable leading pacemaker site in the sinoatrial node center. Further critical parameters include the gradual increase in intercellular coupling from sinoatrial node center to and the presence of electrotonic interaction with atrial cells. the electrotonic effect of the atrium on sinoatrial node periphery is best described as opposing rather than necessarily as often assumed. Multicellular one-dimensional models of sinoatrial node and atrium can provide useful insight into the origin and spread of normal cardiac excitation. They require larger than intercellular conductivities in order to make up for a lack of spatial scaling. Multicellular models for more in-depth quantitative studies will require more realistic anatomico-physiologic properties.

This rotational anisotropy is especially important because it can produce a twist of electrical which measures the rate of rotation activation wavefronts in successive planes perpendicular to a line of phase or filament. This twist can then significantly alter the dynamics of filament. This paper explores this dynamics via numerical simulation. After a review of the we present modeling tools that a simplified ionic model with three membrane currents that approximates well the restitution properties and spiral wave behavior of more complex ionic models of cardiac action potential and a semi-implicit algorithm for the fast solution of monodomain cable equations with rotational anisotropy. We then discuss selected results of a simulation study of vortex dynamics in a parallelepipedal slab of ventricular muscle varying wall thickness and fiber rotation rate The main finding is that rotational anisotropy generates a sufficiently large twist to destabilize a single transmural filament and cause a transition to wave turbulent state characterized by a high density of chaotically moving filaments. This instability is manifested by the propagation of localized disturbances along the filament and has no previously known analog in isotropic excitable media. These disturbances correspond to highly twisted and distorted regions of or that create vortex rings when colliding with the natural boundaries of the ventricle. when sufficiently these rings expand and create additional filaments by further colliding with boundaries. This instability mechanism is distinct from the commonly invoked patchy failure or wave breakup that is not observed here during the initial instability. For modified Beeler-Reuter-like kinetics with stable reentry in two decay into turbulence occurs in the left ventricle in about one second above a critical wall thickness in the range of mm that matches experiment. However this decay is suppressed by uniformly decreasing excitability. Specific experiments to test these and a method to characterize the filament density during fibrillation are discussed.

We also show that oscillation is more cost-effective in inducing the translocation of NFAT than continuous signaling. the lifetime of dephosphorylated NFAT functions as a working memory of signals and enables the control of NFAT nuclear translocation by the frequency of oscillation at a reduced cost of signaling.

Mar Cytokines such as TNF and FASL can trigger death or survival depending on cell lines and cellular conditions. The mechanistic details of how a cell chooses among these cell fates are still unclear. The understanding of these processes is important since they are altered in many including cancer and AIDS. Using a discrete modelling we present a mathematical model of cell fate decision recapitulating and integrating the most consistent facts extracted from the literature. This model provides a generic high-level view of the interplays between NFkappaB pro-survival RIP1-dependent and the apoptosis pathway in response to death receptor-mediated signals. Wild type simulations demonstrate robust segregation of cellular responses to receptor engagement. Model simulations recapitulate documented phenotypes of protein knockdowns and enable the prediction of effects novel knockdowns. In silico experiments simulate the outcomes following ligand removal at different and suggest experimental approaches to further validate and specialise the model for particular cell types. We also propose a reduced conceptual model implementing the logic of decision process. This analysis gives specific predictions regarding cross-talks between the three as well the transient role of RIP1 protein in and confirms the phenotypes of novel perturbations. Our wild type and mutant simulations provide novel insights to restore apoptosis in defective cells. The model analysis expands our understanding of how cell fate decision is made. our current model can be used to assess contradictory or controversial data from the literature. it constitutes a valuable reasoning tool to delineate novel experiments.

Egli Bertram Sellix Freeman ME. Endocrinology Prolactin is secreted from lactotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland of rats in a unique pattern in response to uterine cervical stimulation during mating. Surges of PRL secretion occur in response to relief from hypothalamic dopaminergic inhibition and stimulation by hypothalamic releasing neurohormones. In this we characterized the role of oxytocin in this system and the involvement of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide from the suprachiasmatic nucleus in controlling OT and PRL secretion of CS rats. The effect of OT on PRL secretion was demonstrated in cultured lactotrophs showing simultaneous enhanced secretion rate and increased intracellular Neurosecretory OT cells of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that express VIP receptors were identified by using immunocytochemical techniques in combination with the retrogradely transported neuronal tracer Fluoro-Gold OT measurements of serial blood samples obtained from ovariectomized CS rats displayed a prominent increase at the time of afternoon PRL peak. The injection of VIP antisense oligonucleotides into the SCN abolished afternoon increase of OT and PRL in CS-OVX animals. These findings suggest that VIP from the SCN contributes to the regulation of OT and PRL secretion in CS rats.

To investigate the causal relation of ACTH to the secretion of a mechanistic mathematical model based on current hypotheses of adrenocortical function was constructed and tested. It is widely believed that ACTH stimulates cortisol secretion through adenosine monophosphate which provides substrate cholesterol by activating ester hydrolase and facilitating transport of cholesterol to the side-chain cleavage enzyme. In cholesterol modulates its own synthesis by inhibiting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl reductase in the adrenocortical cell. These and other steps in the biosynthetic reaction sequence were described using differential equations subject to the additional constraints imposed by available measurements of intracellular quantities. The resulting model is consistent with many of the known characteristics of the canine adrenal response to ACTH. In this steady-state nonlinearities arise from cooperative binding of cAMP to its receptor protein and saturation of mitochondrial pregnenolone transport.

BMC Syst Biol. Jan Advances in bioinformatic techniques and analyses have led to the availability of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. The size and complexity of such networks often means that their potential behaviour can only be analysed with constraint-based methods. Whilst requiring minimal experimental such methods are unable to give insight into cellular substrate concentrations. the long-term goal of systems biology is to use kinetic modelling to characterize fully the mechanics of each enzymatic and to combine such knowledge to predict system behaviour. We describe a method for building a parameterized genome-scale kinetic model of a metabolic network. Simplified linlog kinetics are used and the parameters are extracted from a kinetic model repository. We demonstrate our methodology by applying it to yeast metabolism. The resultant model has metabolic reactions involving whilst has considerably broader remit than any existing models of its type. Control analysis is used to identify key steps within the system. Our modelling framework may be considered a stepping-stone toward the long-term goal of a fully-parameterized model of yeast metabolism.

Mathematical models are increasingly used in life sciences. contrary to other biological models are typically over-parametrized and loosely constrained by scarce experimental data and prior knowledge. Recent efforts on analysis of complex models have focused on isolated aspects without considering an integrated approach-ranging from model building to derivation of predictive experiments and refutation or validation of robust model behaviours. we develop such an integrative a sequence of actions expanding upon current efforts with the purpose of setting the stage for a methodology facilitating an extraction of core behaviours and competing mechanistic hypothesis residing within underdetermined models. To this we make use of optimization search statistical classification techniques and cluster-based analysis of the state dynamics and their corresponding parameter sets. We apply the workflow to a mathematical model of fat accumulation in the arterial wall a complex phenomena with limited quantitative thus leading to a model plagued with inherent uncertainty. We find that the mathematical atherogenesis model can still be understood in terms of a few key behaviours despite the large number of parameters. This result enabled us to derive distinct mechanistic predictions from the model despite lack of confidence in the model parameters. We conclude that building integrative workflows enable investigators to embrace modelling of complex biological processes despite uncertainty in parameters.

Aug Up to there have been three published versions of a yeast genome-scale metabolic iND750 and iLL672. All three lack a detailed description of lipid metabolism and thus are unable to be used as integrated scaffolds for gaining insights into lipid metabolism from multilevel omic measurement technologies genome-wide mRNA To overcome this we reconstructed a new version of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome-scale iIN800 that includes a more rigorous and detailed description of lipid metabolism. The reconstructed metabolic model comprises reactions and metabolites. Beyond incorporating new reactions involved in lipid we also present new biomass equations that improve the predictive power of flux balance analysis simulations. Predictions of both growth capability and large scale in silico single gene deletions by iIN800 were consistent with experimental data. In 13C-labeling experiments validated the new biomass equations and calculated intracellular fluxes. To demonstrate the applicability of we show that the model can be used as a scaffold to reveal the regulatory importance of lipid metabolism precursors and intermediates that would have been missed in previous models from transcriptome datasets. Performing integrated analyses using iIN800 as a network scaffold is shown to be a valuable tool for elucidating the behavior of complex metabolic particularly for identifying regulatory targets in lipid metabolism that can be used for industrial applications or for understanding lipid disease states.

Metab Eng. The in vivo dynamics of the pentose phosphate pathway has been studied with transient experiments in continuous culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rapid sampling was performed with a special sampling device after disturbing the steady state with a pulse of glucose. The time span of observation was s after the pulse. During this short time period the dynamic effect of protein biosynthesis can be neglected. The metabolites of interest and we determined with enzymatic assays and HPLC. The experimental observations were then used for the identification of kinetic rate equations and parameters under in vivo conditions. In accordance with results from in vitro studies the in vivo diagnosis supports an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism with noncompetitive inhibition by MgATP2- for the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In the case of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase an ordered Bi-Ter mechanism with a competitive inhibition by MgATP2- has been found. Because the MgATP2- concentration decreases abruptly after the pulse of glucose the inhibitory effect vanishes and the flux through pentose phosphate pathway increases. This regulation phenomenon guarantees the balance of fluxes through glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway during the dynamic time period.

The majority of current systems biology modelling including that of auxin uses numerical simulations to study the behaviour of large systems deterministic ordinary differential with little consideration of alternative modelling frameworks. In this case we solve an auxin-transport model using analytical deterministic numerical simulations and stochastic numerical simulations. Although the three approaches in general predict the same approaches provide different information that we use to gain distinct insights into the modelled biological system. We show in particular that the analytical approach readily provides straightforward mathematical expressions for the concentrations and transport while the stochastic simulations naturally provide information on the variability of system. Our study provides a constructive comparison which highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each the considered modelling approaches.

A stable minimal model of the human cardiovascular system is developed with the ultimate specific aim of assisting medical staff for on site modelling to assist in diagnosis and treatment. Models found in the literature simulate specific areas of the CVS with limited direct usefulness to medical staff. Others model the full CVS as a closed loop but they were found to be very difficult to or unstable. This paper develops a model that uses a minimal number of governing equations with the primary goal of accurately capturing trends in the CVS dynamics in a easily robust model. The model is shown to have long term stability and consistency with non-specific initial conditions as a result. An on pressure close valve law is created to capture the effects of inertia and the resulting dynamics of blood flow through the cardiac valves. An stable solution is performed using a method that varies the number of states in the model depending on the specific phase of the cardiac better matching the real physiological conditions. Examples of results include a drop in cardiac output when increasing the thoracic pressure from to and an increase in blood pressure from to mmHg when the systemic resistance is doubled.

Dynamics of endocytic trafficking can significantly impact cell responses through effects of receptor down-regulation and ligand in turn are governed by binding properties. We describe here a computational model for trafficking dynamics of the IL-2 receptor which is able to predict T cell proliferation responses to IL-2. This model comprises kinetic equations describing and postendocytic sorting of IL-2 and including an experimentally derived dependence of cell proliferation rate on these properties. Computational results from this model predict that IL-2 depletion can be reduced by decreasing its binding affinity for the IL-2R betagamma subunit relative to the alpha subunit at endosomal as a result of enhanced ligand sorting to recycling vis-a-vis and that an IL-2 analogue with such altered binding properties should exhibit increased potency for stimulating the T cell proliferation response.

Chen Popel AS. Free Radic Biol Med Aug Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase produces nitric oxide which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of This predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent such as catalysis by neuronal NOS We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate eNOS and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.

The models have the same action potential shapes and refractoriness as observed in experiments. Using these together with models for the sinoatrial node and atrial we have developed a one-dimensional multicellular model including the SAN and AVN. The multicellular model has slow and fast pathways into the AVN and using it we have analyzed the rich behavior of the AVN. Under normal action potentials were initiated in the SAN center and then propagated through the atrium and AVN. The relationship between the AVN conduction time and the timing of a premature stimulus is consistent with experimental data. After premature atrioventricular nodal reentry could occur. After slow pathway ablation or block of the L-type atrioventricular nodal reentry was abolished. During atrial the AVN limited number of action potentials transmitted to the ventricle. In absence of SAN the inferior nodal extension acted as the pacemaker.

The automaton model is defined by a set of rules that govern the stochastic transitions of each follicle between the successive states L and the subsequent return to A. These transitions occur independently for each after time intervals given stochastically by a distribution characterized by a mean and standard deviation. The follicular automaton model was shown to account both for the dynamical transitions observed in a single and for the behaviour of an ensemble independently cycling follicles. we extend these results and investigate additional properties of the model. We present a deterministic version of the follicular automaton.

Biophys J Experimental evidence suggests that regional differences in action potential morphology can provide a substrate for initiation and maintenance of reentrant arrhythmias in the right atrium but the relationships between complex electrophysiological and anatomical organization of the RA and genesis of reentry are unclear. In this a biophysically detailed three-dimensional computer model of the right atrial tissue was constructed to study the role of tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy in arrhythmogenesis. The model of Lindblad et al. for a rabbit atrial cell was modified to incorporate experimental data on regional differences in several ionic currents and between the crista terminalis and pectinate muscle cells. The modified model was validated by its ability to reproduce the AP properties measured experimentally. The anatomical model of the rabbit RA tissue geometry and fiber was based on a recent histological reconstruction. Simulations with the resultant electrophysiologically and anatomically detailed three-dimensional model show that complex organization of the RA tissue causes breakdown of regular AP conduction patterns at high pacing rates as the AP in crista terminalis cells is and electrotonic coupling transverse to fibers of the crista terminalis is high-frequency pacing at the border between crista terminalis and pectinate muscles results in a unidirectional conduction block toward the crista terminalis and generation of reentry.

Two classes of mechanism have been proposed to explain calcium wave diffusion through gap junctions of the intracellular messenger inositol and diffusion of paracrine extracellular messengers such as ATP. We have used single cell recordings of airway epithelium to parameterize a model of an airway epithelial cell. This was then incorporated into a spatial model of a cell culture where both mechanisms for calcium wave propagation are possible. It is shown that a decreasing return on the radius of wave propagation is achieved as the amount of ATP released from the stimulated cell increases. It is therefore shown that for a wave to propagate large a significant fraction of the intracellular ATP pool would be required to released. Further the radial distribution of maximal calcium response from the stimulated cell does not produce the same flat profile of maximal calcium response seen in experiential studies. This suggests that an additional mechanism is important in wave such as regenerative release of ATP from cells downstream of the stimulated cell.

Wolf Heinrich R. Biochem J Jan Pt On the basis of a detailed model of yeast the effect of intercellular dynamics is analysed theoretically. The model includes the main steps of anaerobic and the production of ethanol and glycerol. Transmembrane diffusion of acetaldehyde is since it has been hypothesized that this substance mediates the interaction. Depending on the kinetic single-cell model shows both stationary and oscillatory behaviour. This agrees with experimental data respect to metabolite concentrations and phase shifts. The inclusion of intercellular coupling leads to a variety of dynamical such as synchronous and different kinds of asynchronous behavior. These oscillations can leading to bi- and tri-rhythmicity. The corresponding parameter regions have been identified by a bifurcation analysis. The oscillatory dynamics of synchronized cell populations are investigated by calculating the phase responses to acetaldehyde pulses. Simulations are performed with respect to the synchronization of two subpopulations that are oscillating out of phase before mixing. The effect of the various process on synchronization is characterized quantitatively. While continuous exchange of acetaldehyde might synchronize the oscillations for appropriate sets of parameter the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally. It is concluded either that addition to the transmembrane exchange of other processes may contribute to intercellular or that intracellular regulator feedback plays a role in the acceleration of synchronization. for appropriate sets of parameter the calculated synchronization time is longer than that observed experimentally.

Model parameters are adjusted to reproduce kinetic slowing data from different Gbetagamma dimeric which produce different degrees of slowing. With these sets of parameter we demonstrate that the range of frequencies filtered out by the autoinhibition varies greatly depending on the Gbetagamma isoform activated by the autoreceptors. It is shown that G protein autoinhibition can enhance the spatial contrast between a spatially distributed high-frequency signal and surrounding low-frequency providing an alternate mechanism to lateral inhibition. It is also shown that autoinhibition can increase the fidelity of coincidence detection by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio in the postsynaptic cell. The filter the input frequency below which signals are depends on several biophysical parameters in addition to those related Gbetagamma binding and unbinding.

The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral the model replicates human sleep-wake with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes with most time spent in stable steady states corresponding to wake and with transitions between them on a timescale of few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake with a region of bistability the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less as in narcolepsy.

Tabak Mascagni Bertram R. J Neurophysiol Feb ahead of Spontaneous episodic activity is a fundamental mode of operation developing networks. the duration of an episode activity correlates with the length of silent interval that precedes but not with the interval that follows. Here we use a modeling approach to explain this characteristic but so far unexplained feature of developing networks. Because the correlation pattern is observed in networks with different structures and a satisfactory model needs to generate the right pattern of activity regardless the details of network architecture or individual cell properties. We thus developed simple models incorporating excitatory coupling between heterogeneous neurons and activity-dependent synaptic depression. These models robustly generated episodic activity with the correct correlation pattern. The pattern resulted from episodes being triggered at random levels of recovery from depression while they terminated around the same level of depression. To explain this fundamental difference between episode onset and we then used a mean field where only average activity and level of recovery from synaptic depression are considered. In this episode onset is highly sensitive to inputs. noise resulting from random coincidences in the spike times of individual neurons led to the high variability at episode onset and to the observed correlation pattern.

In this we simulated mutations in genes linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular the first located in calsequestrin and the second in ryanodine receptor The aim of the study was to investigate the mechanistic basis for spontaneous release events that lead to delayed afterdepolarizations in affected patients. Sarcoplasmic reticulum luminal sensing was incorporated into a model of the human ventricular and CSQN2 mutations were modeled by simulating disrupted RyR2 luminal sensing. In voltage-clamp the mutant CSQN2 model recapitulated the smaller calcium time to peak calcium and accelerated recovery from inactivation seen in experiments. In current clamp in the presence of beta we observed delayed suggesting that accelerated recovery of RyR2 induced by impaired luminal sensing underlies the triggered activity observed in mutant CSQN2-expressing myocytes. In current-clamp in a model of mutant RyR2 that is characterized by reduced FKBP12.6 binding to the RyR2 on beta the impaired coupled gating characteristic of these mutations was modeled by reducing cooperativity of RyR2 activation. In current-clamp the mutant RyR2 model exhibited increased diastolic RyR2 open probability that resulted in formation of delayed afterdepolarizations.

The model exhibits two steady an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T is less a critical then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative and this state is stable. For N the uninfected state is and the endemically infected state can be either or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is it characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in model. The model predicts that different viral characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate at different rates.

Gupta Aslakson Gurbaxani Vernon SD. Theor Biol Med Model Feb The primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this low GR concentration represents the normal steady and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an low cortisol state.

Considering the extreme inter-individual variability of absorption and metabolism of population-based PK would be useful to provide insight into the relationship between blood and clinical effects of methadone. To address this an age-dependent physiologically based pharmacokinetic model has been constructed to systematically study methadone metabolism and PK. The model will facilitate the design of cost-effective studies that will evaluate methadone PK and PD may be useful to guide methadone dosing in children. The PBPK which includes whole-body multi-organ plasma protein and is parameterized based on a database of pediatric PK parameters and data collected from clinical experiments. The model is further tailored and verified based on PK data from individual then scaled appropriately to apply children aged months. Based on measured variability in CYP3A enzyme expression levels and plasma orosomucoid a Monte-Carlo-based simulation of methadone kinetics in a pediatric population was performed. The simulation predicts extreme variability in plasma concentrations and clearance kinetics for methadone in the pediatric based on standard dosing protocols.

These methods use either GC-electron-capture detection of trifluoroacetyl and heptafluorobutyryl derivatives or HPLC with UV or photodiode array detection of analytes. A new HPLC procedure using fluorescence detection prior derivatisation with coumarin-3-carbonyl chloride has been also tested. Five extraction solvents and two solid-phase extraction cartridges plus a especial clean-up column were compared in order to obtain the best recovery of the mycotoxins with minimal presence of coextractives in the chromatograms. The chosen extraction solvent was a mixture of acetonitrile-water The MycoSep column was chosen as the best alternative for clean-up of grain samples. For GC-ECD derivatisation of analytes with heptafluorobutyric anhydride prior the final determination was chosen as the most suitable procedure. HPLC-photodiode array analysis was more suitable for determination of type B trichothecenes than HPLC of the fluorescent coumarin-3-carbonyl derivatives.

Wodarz Sierro Klenerman P. J R Soc Interface Jun Upon acute viral a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as memory In order to examine the dynamics of this system we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific cells seen in humans as they age.

Assuming that the variation among cells with respect to this delay can be approximated by a gamma high flexible distribution that can mimic a variety of biologically plausible we provide analytical solutions for the expected decline in plasma virus concentration after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy with one or more protease inhibitors. We then use the model to investigate whether the parameters that characterize viral dynamics can be identified from biological data. Using non-linear least-squares regression to fit the model to simulated data in which the delays conform to a gamma we show that good estimates for free viral clearance infected cell death and parameters characterizing the gamma distribution can be obtained. For simulated data sets in which the delays were generated using other biologically plausible reasonably good estimates for viral clearance infected cell death and mean delay times can be obtained using the gamma-delay model. For simulated data sets that include added simulated viral clearance rate estimates are not as reliable. If the mean intracellular delay is we show that reasonable estimates for the viral clearance rate can be obtained by taking the harmonic mean of viral clearance rate estimates from a group of patients.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A Dec We use mathematical models to study the relationship between HIV and the immune system during the natural course of infection and in the context of different antiviral treatment regimes. The models suggest that an efficient cytotoxic T lymphocyte memory response is required to control the virus. We define CTL memory as long-term persistence of CTL precursors in the absence of antigen. Infection and depletion of T helper cells interfere with CTL memory resulting in persistent viral replication and disease progression. We find that antiviral drug therapy during primary infection can enable the development of CTL memory. In chronically infected specific treatment either including deliberate drug holidays or antigenic boosts of the immune can lead to a re-establishment of CTL memory.

Biophys J Jul Slow and discontinuous wave conduction through nonuniform junctions in cardiac tissues is generally considered unsafe and proarrythmogenic. the relationships between tissue wave conduction and safety at such junctions are unknown. We have developed a structurally and electrophysiologically detailed model of the canine Purkinje-ventricular junction and varied its heterogeneity parameters to determine such relationships. We show that neither very fast nor slow conduction is and there exists an optimal velocity that provides the maximum safety factor for conduction through the junction. The resultant conduction time delay across the PVJ is a natural consequence of the electrophysiological and morphological differences between the Purkinje fiber and ventricular tissue. The delay allows the PVJ to accumulate and pass sufficient charge to excite the adjacent ventricular but is not long enough for the source-to-load mismatch at the junction to be enhanced over time.

The model exhibits two steady an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T is less a critical then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative and this state is stable. For N the uninfected state is and the endemically infected state can be either or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is it characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in model. The model predicts that different viral characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate at different rates.

We augmented an earlier mathematical model of skeletal muscle glycogenolysis with pH-dependent enzyme kinetics and reaction equilibria to compute the time course of pH changes. Analysis shows that kinetics and final equilibrium states of the closed system are highly constrained by the pH-dependent parameters. This kinetic model of coupled to creatine kinase and adenylate simulated published experiments made with a cell-free enzyme mixture to reconstitute the network and to synthesize PCr and lactate in vitro. Using the enzyme kinetic and thermodynamic data in the simulations required minimal adjustments of parameters to describe the data. These results show that incorporation of appropriate physical chemistry of the reactions with accurate kinetic modeling gives a reasonable simulation of experimental data and is necessary for a physically correct representation of the metabolic network. The approach is general for modeling metabolic networks beyond the specific pathway and conditions presented here. This model was taken from the CellML repository and automatically converted to SBML.

Perelson Kirschner De Boer R. Math Biosci We examine a model for the interaction of HIV with T cells that considers four uninfected T latently infected actively T and free virus. Using this model we show that many of the puzzling quantitative features of HIV infection can be explained simply. We also consider effects of AZT on viral growth and T-cell population dynamics. The model exhibits two steady an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T is less a critical then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative and this state is stable. For N the uninfected state is and the endemically infected state can be either or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is it characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in model. The model predicts that different viral characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate at different rates.

Nelson Perelson AS. Math Biosci The administration of a genetically engineered defective interfering virus that interferes with HIV-1 replication has been proposed as a therapy for HIV-1 infection and AIDS. The proposed interfering which is designed to superinfect HIV-1 infected carries ribozymes that cleave conserved regions in HIV-1 RNA that code for the viral envelope protein. Thus DIV infection of HIV-1 infected cells should reduce or eliminate viral production by these cells. The success of this therapeutic strategy will depend both on the intercellular interaction of DIV and on the overall dynamics of virus and T cells in the body. To study these dynamical we have constructed a mathematical model of the interaction and cells in vivo. The results of both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation indicate that survival of the engineered DIV purely on a peripheral blood HIV-1 infection is unlikely. analytical results indicate that DIV might well survive on HIV-1 infected cells in lymphoid organs such as lymph nodes and or on other HIV-1 infected cells in these organs.

Kroll MH. Bull Math Biol Parathyroid hormone paradoxically causes net bone loss when administered in a continuous and net bone formation when administered intermittently. Currently no pharmacological formulations are available to promote bone as needed for the treatment of osteoporosis. The paradoxical behavior of PTH confuses a model bone resorption or deposition dependent on the timing of PTH administration would de-mystify this behavior and provide the basis for logical drug formulation. We developed a mathematical model that accounts for net bone loss with continuous PTH administration and net bone formation with intermittent PTH based on the differential effects of PTH on the osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations of cells. being a major reservoir of body is under the hormonal control of PTH. The overall effect of PTH is to raise plasma levels of partly through bone resorption. Osteoclasts resorb bone and liberate but they lack receptors for PTH. The preosteoblastic precursors and preosteoblasts possess receptors for upon which the hormone induces differentiation from the precursor to preosteoblast and from the preosteoblast to osteoblast. The osteoblasts generate IL-6 stimulates preosteoclasts to differentiate into osteoclasts. We developed a mathematical model for the differentiation of osteoblastic and osteoclastic populations in using a delay time of hour for differentiation of preosteoblastic precursors into preosteoblasts and hours for the differentiation of preosteoblasts into osteoblasts. The ratio of the number osteoblasts to osteoclasts indicates the net effect of PTH on bone resorption and the timing of events producing the maximum ratio would induce net bone deposition. When PTH is pulsed with a frequency of every the preosteoblastic population rises and decreases in nearly a symmetric with peaks every and hours when PTH is administered every hours. the preosteoblast and osteoblast frequency depends more on the nearly constant value of the rather than on the frequency of PTH pulsations. Increasing the time delay gradually increases the mean value for the number of osteoblasts. The osteoblastic population oscillates for all intermittent administrations of PTH and even when the PTH infusion is constant. The maximum ratio of osteoblasts to osteoclasts occurs when PTH is administered in pulses of every hours. The delay features in the model bear most of the responsibility for occurrence of these because without the delay and in the presence of constant PTH no oscillations occur. with a under constant PTH the model generates oscillations. The osteoblast oscillations express limit cycle behavior. Phase plane analysis show simple and complex attractors. Subsequent to a disturbance in the number of osteoblasts quickly regain their oscillatory behavior and cycle back to the original typical of limit cycle behavior. because the model was constructed with dissipative and nonlinear one would expect ensuing oscillations to show limit cycle behavior. The results from our increased bone deposition with intermittent PTH administration and increased bone resorption with constant PTH conforms with experimental observations and with an accepted explanation for osteoporosis.

Wodarz Sierro Klenerman P. J R Soc Interface Jun Upon acute viral a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as memory In order to examine the dynamics of this system we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions.

This model is constructed based on detailed kinetics and thermodynamically balanced reaction mechanisms and a strict accounting of rapidly equilibrating biochemical species. Since building such a model requires introducing a large number of adjustable kinetic a correspondingly large amount of independent data from isolated mitochondria respiring on different substrates and subject to a variety of protocols is used to parameterize the model and ensure that it is challenged by a wide range of data corresponding to diverse conditions. The developed model is further validated by both in vitro data on isolated cardiac mitochondria and in vivo experimental measurements on human skeletal muscle. The validated model is used to predict the roles of NAD and ADP in regulating the tricarboxylic acid cycle dehydrogenase demonstrating that NAD is the more important regulator. Further model predictions reveal that a decrease of cytosolic pH value results in decreases mitochondrial membrane potential and a corresponding drop in the ability of mitochondria to synthesize ATP at the hydrolysis potential required for cellular function.

The model consists of four differential based on known reaction that can be solved to give the time course of the concentrations four main substrates in the cycle under various circumstances. We show that the behavior of model in response to genetic abnormalities and dietary deficiencies is similar to the changes seen in a wide variety of experimental studies.

The model relies on the framework of rabbit myocyte model previously developed by our with subsarcolemmal and junctional compartments where ion channels sense higher vs. bulk cytosol. Ion channels and transporters have been modeled on the basis of most recent experimental data from human ventricular myocytes. Rapidly and slowly inactivating components of have been formulated to differentiate between endocardial and epicardial myocytes. Transmural gradients of Ca handling proteins and Na pump were also simulated. The model has been validated against a wide set of experimental data including action potential duration adaptation and frequency-dependent increase in Ca transient peak and Na accumulation at fast heart rate is a major determinant of APD via outward shifts in Na pump and Na-Ca exchange currents. We investigated the effects of blocking K currents on APD and repolarization block does not affect the former and slightly reduces the blockade modestly increases APD and more strongly reduces repolarization blockers significantly prolong an effect exacerbated as pacing frequency is in good agreement with experimental results in human myocytes.

Perelson Kirschner De Boer R. Math Biosci We examine a model for the interaction of HIV with T cells that considers four uninfected T latently infected actively T and free virus.

The model exhibits two steady an uninfected state in which no virus is present and an endemically infected in which virus and infected T cells are present. We show that if the number of infectious virions produced per actively infected T is less a critical then the uninfected state is the only steady state in the nonnegative and this state is stable. For N the uninfected state is and the endemically infected state can be either or unstable and surrounded by a stable limit cycle. Using numerical bifurcation techniques we map out the parameter regimes of these various behaviors. oscillatory behavior seems to lie outside the region of biologically realistic parameter values. When the endemically infected state is it characterized by a reduced number of T cells compared with the uninfected state. Thus T-cell depletion occurs through the establishment of a new steady state. The dynamics of the establishment this new steady state are examined both numerically and via the quasi-steady-state approximation. We develop approximations for the dynamics at early times in which the free virus rapidly binds to T during an intermediate time scale in which the virus grows and a third time scale on which viral growth slows and the endemically infected steady state is approached. Using the quasi-steady-state approximation model can be simplified to two ordinary differential equations the summarize much of the dynamical behavior. We compute the level of T cells in the endemically infected state and show how that level varies with the parameters in model. The model predicts that different viral characterized by generating differing numbers of infective virions within infected T can cause different amounts of T-cell depletion and generate at different rates.

At the same they can cause disease when induced inappropriately. Which factors regulate CTL and decide whether they should remain silent or react is open to debate. The phenomenon called cross-priming has received attention in this respect. That CTL expansion occurs if antigen is recognized on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells This is in contrast to direct presentation where antigen is seen on the surface of target cells infected or tumor Here we introduce a mathematical which takes the phenomenon of cross-priming into account. We propose a new mechanism of regulation which is implicit in the dynamics of According to the ability of a CTL response to become established depends on the ratio of cross-presentation to direct presentation of the antigen. If this ratio is relatively CTL responses are likely to become established. If this ratio is relatively tolerance the likely outcome. The behavior of the model includes a parameter region where the outcome depends on the initial conditions. We discuss our results with respect to the idea of discrimination and the danger signal hypothesis. We apply the model to study the role of CTL in cancer and therapeutic vaccination against cancers.

Wodarz Sierro Klenerman P. J R Soc Interface Jun Upon acute viral a typical cytotoxic T lymphocyte response is characterized by a phase of expansion and contraction after which it settles at a relatively stable memory level. experimental data from mice infected with murine cytomegalovirus showed different and unusual dynamics. After acute infection had some antigen specific CTL started to expand over time despite the fact that no replicative virus was detectable. This phenomenon has been termed as memory In order to examine the dynamics of this system we developed a mathematical model analysing the impact of innate and adaptive immune responses. According to this a potentially important contributor to CTL inflation is competition between the specific CTL response and an innate natural killer cell response. Inflation occurs most readily if the NK cell response is more efficient than the CTL at reducing virus load during acute but thereafter maintains a chronic virus load which is sufficient to induce CTL proliferation. The model further suggests that weaker NK cell mediated protection can correlate with more pronounced CTL inflation dynamics over time. We present experimental data from mice infected with MCMV which are consistent with the theoretical predictions. This model provides valuable information and may help to explain the inflation of CMV specific cells seen in humans as they age.

J Physiol Jun Rates of ATPase and glycolysis are several times faster in actively contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus muscle than soleus but we find these rates are not distinguishable at rest. We used a transient anoxic perturbation of steady state energy balance to decrease phosphocreatine reversibly and to measure the rates of ATPase and lactate production without muscle activation or contraction. The rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis is less than the ATPase accounting for the continual PCr decrease during anoxia in both muscles. We fitted a mathematical model validated with properties of enzymes and solutes measured in vitro and appropriate for the transient perturbation of these muscles to experimental data test whether the model accounts for the results. Simulations showed equal rates of ATPase and lactate production in both muscles. ATPase controls glycolytic flux by feedback from its products. Adenylate kinase function is critical because a rise in is necessary to activate glycogen phosphorylase. ATPase is the primary source of production. The sum of contributions the reactions of glycogenolytic and glycolytic network to total proton load is negligible. The stoichiometry of lactate and production is near unity. These results identify a default state of energy metabolism for resting muscle in which there is no difference in the metabolic phenotype of EDL and SOL. additional control involving higher ATPase flux and must exist to explain the well-known difference in glycolytic rates fast-twitch and slow-twitch muscles in actively contracting muscle.

Benson Aslanidi Zhang Holden AV. Prog Biophys Mol Biol We have constructed computational models of canine ventricular cells and ultimately combining detailed tissue architecture and heterogeneous transmural electrophysiology. The heterogeneity is introduced by modifying the Hund-Rudy canine cell model in order to reproduce experimentally reported electrophysiological properties of midmyocardial and epicardial cells. These models are validated against experimental data for individual ionic current and action potential their rate dependencies. 1D and 3D heterogeneous virtual tissues are with detailed tissue architecture and due to fibre orientation and sheet of the left ventricular wall wedge extracted from a diffusion tensor imaging data set. The models are used to study the effects of tissue heterogeneity and class III drugs on transmural propagation and tissue vulnerability to re-entry. We have determined relationships between the transmural dispersion of action potential duration and the vulnerable window in the 1D virtual ventricular and demonstrated how changes in the transmural and hence tissue can lead to generation of re-entry in the 3D ventricular wedge. Two class III drugs with opposite qualitative effects on transmural APD heterogeneity are d-sotalol that increases transmural APD and amiodarone that decreases it. Simulations with the 1D virtual ventricular wall show that under d-sotalol conditions the vulnerable window is substantially wider compared to amiodarone primarily in the epicardial region where unidirectional conduction block persists until the adjacent M cells are fully repolarised. Further simulations with the 3D ventricular wedge have shown that ectopic stimulation of the epicardial region results in generation of sustained re-entry under d-sotalol but not under amiodarone conditions or in control. APD increase in M cells was identified as the major contributor to tissue vulnerability--re-entry was initiated primarily due to ectopic excitation propagating around the unidirectional conduction block in the M cell region. This suggests an electrophysiological mechanism for the anti- and proarrhythmic effects of the class III relative safety of amiodarone in comparison to d-sotalol can be explained by relatively low transmural APD and a narrow vulnerable window and low probability of re-entry in the tissue.

The model is based on the hypothesis that wave is the result of diffusion inositol trisphosphate from the stimulated cell.

This is because the conductance of inward background non-selective cation current balances with the outward conductance.

Calibration gives an improved parameter in which the form of homeostatic drive is better and its weighting relative to the circadian drive is increased. Within the newly constrained parameter the model predicts repayment of sleep debt consistent with experiment in both quantity and asymptoting to a maximum repayment for very long deprivations. Recovery is found to depend on circadian and the model predicts that it is most efficient to recover during normal sleeping phases of the circadian in terms of the amount recovery sleep required. The form of the homeostatic drive suggests that periods of wake during recovery from sleep deprivation are phases of relative in the sense that homeostatic drive continues to converge toward baseline levels.

Gupta Aslakson Gurbaxani Vernon SD. Theor Biol Med Model Feb The primary stress management system is the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis. The HPA axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the cortisol level. Dysregulation of the HPA axis is implicated in numerous stress-related diseases. We developed a structured model of the HPA axis that includes the glucocorticoid receptor This model incorporates nonlinear kinetics of pituitary GR synthesis. The nonlinear effect arises from the fact that GR homodimerizes after cortisol activation and induces its own synthesis in the pituitary. This homodimerization makes possible two stable steady states and one unstable state of cortisol production resulting in bistability of the HPA axis. In this low GR concentration represents the normal steady and high GR concentration represents a dysregulated steady state. A short stress in the normal steady state produces a small perturbation in the GR concentration that quickly returns to normal levels. repeated stress produces persistent and high GR concentration that does not return to baseline forcing the HPA axis to an alternate steady state. One consequence of increased steady state GR is reduced steady state which has been observed in some stress related disorders such as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Inclusion of pituitary GR expression resulted in a biologically plausible model of HPA axis bistability and hypocortisolism. High GR concentration enhanced cortisol negative feedback on the hypothalamus and forced the HPA axis into an low cortisol state.

J Physiol Jun Rates of ATPase and glycolysis are several times faster in actively contracting mouse extensor digitorum longus muscle than soleus but we find these rates are not distinguishable at rest. We used a transient anoxic perturbation of steady state energy balance to decrease phosphocreatine reversibly and to measure the rates of ATPase and lactate production without muscle activation or contraction. The rate of glycolytic ATP synthesis is less than the ATPase accounting for the continual PCr decrease during anoxia in both muscles. We fitted a mathematical model validated with properties of enzymes and solutes measured in vitro and appropriate for the transient perturbation of these muscles to experimental data test whether the model accounts for the results. Simulations showed equal rates of ATPase and lactate production in both muscles. ATPase controls glycolytic flux by feedback from its products. Adenylate kinase function is critical because a rise in is necessary to activate glycogen phosphorylase. ATPase is the primary source of production. The sum of contributions the reactions of glycogenolytic and glycolytic network to total proton load is negligible. The stoichiometry of lactate and production is near unity.

In this we used a computational approach to test the hypothesis that in cardiac ventricular myocytes the effects of receptor and muscarinic activation involve compartmentation of cAMP. A model consisting of two submembrane and microdomains one bulk cytosolic domain was created using published information on the location of and as well the location of stimulatory and inhibitory adenylyl cyclase isoforms inhibited and stimulated by multiple phosphodiesterase isoforms and Results obtained with the model indicate bulk basal cAMP can be high approximately and only modestly stimulated by activation approximately but caveolar cAMP varies in a range more appropriate for regulation of protein kinase A approximately nM to activation strongly reduces the increases in caveolar with less effect on bulk and during weak activation not only reduces caveolar but also produces a rebound increase in caveolar cAMP following termination of activity.

We the control of direction the mitochondrial and cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase the role of mitochondrial bifunctional the role of glycine cleavage the effects of variations in serine and glycine the effects of methionine and protein loading. The model reproduces many experimental findings and gives new insights into the underlying properties of mitochondrial folate metabolism. Particularly interesting is the remarkable stability of formate production in the mitochondria face of large changes in serine and glycine input. The model shows that in the presence of bifunctional enzyme in embryonic tissues and cancer the mitochondria primarily support cytosolic purine and pyrimidine synthesis via the export of while in adult tissues the mitochondria produce serine for gluconeogenesis. This model does not reproduce the results in article but most steady state concentrations are in a range of around the published values. Also parameterscans give nearly identical results as shown in the article. In SBML version model the volumes of cytoplasm and the cell were all set to one obtain the same equations as described in the supplemental materials of the article. The total folate is equally split between the cytosol and mitochondrion divided by for the cytosol and for the respectively. To obtain an SBML model in which the volumes of cytosol and mito are the model needs to be altered as for the initial distribution of folate the terms and have to be replaced by volumes of cytosol and mitochondria respectively in the transport reactions between mitochondrion and cytosol the stoichiometry of mitochondrial reactants has to be set from to and in the first part of the according rate laws the factor should simply be replaced with mito the stoichiometries of src and dmg have to be changed for mitchondrial and cytosolic reactions involving these two species. While the concentrations stay same after these the reaction fluxes change by a factor of cytosol and mito for cytosolic and mitchondrial respectively.

Temporal control of the signaling module that contains IkappaB kinase its substrate inhibitor of NF-kappaB and the key inflammatory transcription factor NF-kappaB can allow for selective gene activation. We have demonstrated that different inflammatory stimuli induce distinct IKK and we examined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Although tumor necrosis factor-alpha IKK activity was rapidly attenuated by negative lipopolysaccharide signaling and LPS-specific gene expression programs were dependent on a cytokine-mediated positive feedback mechanism. the distinct biological responses to LPS and TNFalpha depend on signaling pathway-specific mechanisms that regulate the temporal profile of IKK activity. The model was implemented according to the description in supplemental materials and by comparison to the matlab files provided by Prof. Hoffmann. It includes a delay for the induced transcription of IκBε mRNA. For the IKK input one of the randomly generated profiles was used.

Glycolysis in yeast is a good although high-quality quantitative data are well-established mathematical models typically only cover direct regulation of the involved enzymes by metabolite binding. The effect of various metabolites on the enzyme kinetics is summarized in carefully developed mathematical formulae. this approach implicitly assumes that the enzyme concentrations themselves are thus neglecting other regulatory levels e.g. transcriptional and translational regulation--involved in the regulation of enzyme activities. It is that different experimental conditions result in different enzyme activities regulated by the above mechanisms. Detailed modeling of all regulatory levels is still out of reach since some of the necessary data e.g. quantitative large scale enzyme concentration data sets are lacking or rare. a viable approach is to include the regulation of enzyme concentrations into an established model and to investigate whether this improves the predictive capabilities. Proteome data are usually hard to but levels of mRNA transcripts may be used instead as clues for changes in enzyme concentrations. Here we investigate whether including mRNA data into an established model of yeast glycolysis allows to predict the steady state metabolic concentrations for different experimental conditions. To this we modified an established ODE model for the glycolytic pathway of yeast to include changes of enzyme concentrations. Presumable changes were inferred from mRNA transcript level measurement data. We investigate how this approach can be used to predict metabolite concentrations for steady-state yeast cultures at five different oxygen levels ranging from anaerobic to fully aerobic conditions. We were partly able to reproduce the experimental data and present a number of changes that were necessary to improve the modeling result. Further modifications to this model and improved data fit will be presented soon. This model originates from BioModels A Database of Annotated Published Models It is copyright The BioModels.net Team.

The reconstruction itself represents a knowledge base of the metabolism as would greatly assist further investigations on archaeal pathways. In we experimentally determined several parameters relevant to including a characterization of the biomass composition and a quantification of carbon and oxygen consumption. Using the metabolic reconstruction and the experimental we formulated a constraints-based model which we used to analyze the behavior of archaeon when grown on a single carbon source. Results of the analysis include finding that Natronomonas when grown aerobically on uses a carbon to oxygen consumption ratio that is theoretically near-optimal with respect to growth and energy production. This supports the hypothesis under simple the microorganism optimizes its metabolism with respect to the two objectives. We also found that the archaeon has a very low carbon efficiency of only about This inefficiency is probably due to a very low ratio as well to the other difficulties posed by its extreme environment.

Cottret Milreu Acuña Marchetti-Spaccamela Stougie Charles Sagot MF. PLoS Comput Biol. Sep e1000904. Endosymbiotic bacteria from different species can live inside cells of the same eukaryotic organism. Metabolic exchanges occur between host and bacteria but also between different endocytobionts. Since a complete genome annotation is available for we built the metabolic network of two endosymbiotic Sulcia muelleri and Baumannia that live inside specific cells of the sharpshooter Homalodisca coagulata and studied the metabolic exchanges involving transfers of carbon atoms between the three. We automatically determined the set of metabolites potentially exogenously acquired for both metabolic networks. We show that the number of seeds needed by both bacteria in the carbon metabolism is extremely reduced. only three seeds are common to both metabolic indicating that the complementarity of two metabolisms is not only manifested in the metabolic capabilities of each but also by their different use of the same environment. our results show that the carbon metabolism of S. muelleri may be completely independent of the metabolic network of B. cicadellinicola. On the carbon metabolism of the latter appears dependent on the metabolism of S. at least for two essential amino threonine and lysine. in order to define which subsets of seeds are sufficient to produce the metabolites involved in a symbiotic we used a graph-based that we recently developed. Our results highly refine our knowledge about the complementarity between metabolisms of the two bacteria and their host. We thus indicate seeds that appear obligatory in the synthesis of metabolites are involved in the symbiotic function.

Chang Xie Bourne Palsson BØ. PLoS Comput Biol. Sep Recent advances in structural bioinformatics have enabled the prediction of protein-drug off-targets based on their ligand binding sites. Concurrent developments in systems biology allow for prediction of the functional effects of system perturbations using large-scale network models. Integration of these two capabilities provides a framework for evaluating metabolic drug response phenotypes in silico. This combined approach was applied to investigate the hypertensive side effect of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor torcetrapib in the context of human renal function. A metabolic kidney model was generated in which to simulate drug treatment. Causal off-targets were predicted that have previously been observed to impact renal function in gene-deficient patients and may play a role in the adverse side effects observed in clinical trials. Genetic risk factors for drug treatment were also predicted that correspond to both characterized and unknown renal metabolic disorders as well cryptic genetic deficiencies that are not expected to exhibit a renal disorder phenotype except under drug treatment. This study represents a novel integration of structural and systems biology a first step towards computational systems medicine.

To mimic these Lactobacillus plantarum was grown in a carbon-limited retentostat with complete biomass retention. The physiology of extremely slow-growing L. plantarum--as studied by genome-scale modeling and transcriptomics--was fundamentally different from that of stationary-phase cells. Stress resistance mechanisms were not massively induced during transition to extremely slow growth. The energy-generating metabolism was remarkably stable and remained largely based on the conversion of glucose to lactate. The combination of metabolic and transcriptomic analyses revealed behaviors involved in interactions with the more particularly with production of plant hormones or precursors and preparedness for the utilization of plant-derived substrates. the production of compounds interfering with plant root development was demonstrated in slow-growing L. plantarum. conditions of slow growth and limited substrate availability seem to trigger a plant environment-like even in the absence of plant-derived suggesting that this might constitute an intrinsic behavior in L. plantarum.

In this we report a systems biological approach that efficiently utilizes genomic information for drug targeting and apply this approach to the opportunistic pathogen Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6. we partially re-sequenced and fully re-annotated the V. vulnificus CMCP6 and accordingly reconstructed its genome-scale metabolic VvuMBEL943. The validated network model was employed to systematically predict drug targets using the concept of metabolite along with additional filtering criteria. Target genes encoding enzymes that interact with the five essential metabolites finally selected were experimentally validated. These five essential metabolites are critical to the survival of and hence were used to guide the cost-effective selection of chemical which were then screened for antimicrobial activity in a whole-cell assay. This approach is expected to help fill the existing gap between genomics and drug discovery. This metabolic network model has been thoroughly validated by the authors.

MacDonald Thomas Douglas AE. Mol Ecol. The pervasive influence of resident microorganisms on the phenotype of their hosts is exemplified by the intracellular bacterium Buchnera which provides its aphid partner with essential amino acids We investigated variation in the dietary requirement for EAAs among four pea aphid clones. Buchnera-derived nitrogen contributed to the synthesis of all EAAs for which aphid clones required a dietary and to none of the EAAs for which all four clones had no dietary suggesting that low total dietary nitrogen may select for reduced synthesis of certain EAAs in some aphid clones. The sequenced Buchnera genomes showed that the EAA nutritional phenotype the profile of dietary EAAs required by the cannot be attributed to sequence variation of Buchnera genes coding EAA biosynthetic enzymes. Metabolic modelling by flux balance analysis demonstrated that EAA output from Buchnera can be determined precisely by the flux of host metabolic precursors to Buchnera. the four EAA nutritional phenotypes could be reproduced by metabolic models with unique profiles of host dominated by variation in supply of homocysteine and glutamate. This suggests that the nutritional phenotype of the symbiosis is determined principally by host metabolism and transporter genes that regulate nutrient supply to Buchnera. Intraspecific variation in the nutritional phenotype of symbioses is expected to mediate partitioning of plant resources among aphid potentially promoting the genetic subdivision of aphid populations. In this microbial symbioses may play an important role in the evolutionary diversification of phytophagous insects.

A signaling pathway model of spines that express D1-type dopamine receptors was constructed to analyze the dynamic mechanisms of dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. The model incorporated all major signaling including dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of kDa as well AMPA receptor trafficking in the post-synaptic membrane. Simulations with dopamine and calcium inputs reproduced dopamine- and calcium-dependent plasticity. Further in silico experiments revealed that the positive feedback loop consisted of protein kinase A phosphatase 2A and the phosphorylation site at threonine of DARPP-32 served as the major switch for inducing LTD and LTP. Calcium input modulated this loop through the PP2B kinase pathway and whereas calcium dopamine input activated the loop via PKA activation by cyclic AMP The positive feedback loop displayed robust bi-stable responses following changes in the reaction parameters. Increased basal dopamine levels disrupted this dopamine-dependent plasticity. The present model elucidated the mechanisms involved in bidirectional regulation of corticostriatal synapses and will allow for further exploration into causes and therapies for dysfunctions such as drug addiction. The model was encoded from the supplemental material accompanying the article. The stimuli used in the article are hard to implement in so right now the model does not reproduce the results given in the article.

Barbara Di Ventura and Victor Sourjik. Molecular Systems Biology Jan How cells manage to get equal distribution of their structures and molecules at cell division is a crucial issue in biology. In a feedback mechanism could always ensure equality by measuring and correcting the distribution in progeny. an elegant alternative could be a mechanism relying on with the interplay between system properties and cell geometry leading to the emergence of equal partitioning. The problem is exemplified by the bacterial Min system that defines the division site by oscillating from pole to pole. Unequal partitioning of Min proteins at division could negatively impact system performance and cell growth because of loss Min oscillations and imprecise mid-cell determination. In this we combine live cell and computational analyses to show that known properties of the Min system together with the gradual reduction of protein exchange through the constricting septum are sufficient to explain the observed highly precise spontaneous protein partitioning. Our findings reveal a novel and effective mechanism of protein partitioning in dividing cells and emphasize the importance of self-organization in basic cellular processes.

While these pathways have been questions such as temporal effects and the dynamics of multi-mediator regulation remain to be fully studied. Mathematical modeling of these pathways facilitates such studies. Based on the published ordinary differential equation models of the pathway we developed an integrated model of and VEGF-mediated MLC activation pathways. Our model was validated against experimental data for calcium release and VEGF-mediated MLC activation. The simulated effects of Rho VEGF and VEGFR2 over-expression on MLC and the collective modulation by thrombin and histamine are consistent with experimental findings. Our model was used to predict enhanced MLC activation by CPI-17 over-expression and by synergistic action of thrombin and VEGF at low mediator levels. These may have impact in endothelial permeability and metastasis in cancer patients with blood coagulation. Our model was validated against a number of experimental findings and the observed synergistic effects of low concentrations thrombin and histamine in mediating the activation of MLC. It can be used to predict the effects of altered pathway collective actions of multiple mediators and the potential impact to various diseases.

Telesco Shih Jia Radhakrishnan R. Mol Biosyst. Multiscale modeling provides a powerful and quantitative platform for investigating the complexity inherent in intracellular signaling pathways and rationalizing the effects of molecular perturbations on downstream signaling events and on the cell phenotype. Here we describe the application of a multiscale modeling scheme to the receptor tyrosine kinase signaling which regulates critical cellular processes including migration and differentiation. The HER3 kinase is a topic of current interest and as it has been implicated in mechanisms of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibition of EGFR and HER2 in the treatment of many human malignancies. the commonly regarded status of HER3 as a catalytically inactive has recently been challenged by our previous which demonstrated robust residual kinase activity for HER3. Through our multiscale we investigate the most significant molecular interactions that contribute to potential mechanisms of HER3 activity and the physiological relevance of this activity to mechanisms of drug resistance in an ErbB-driven tumor cell in silico. The results of our molecular-scale simulations support the characterization of HER3 as a weakly active kinase in contrast to its fully-active ErbB family depends upon a unique hydrophobic interface to coordinate the alignment of specific catalytic residues required for its activity. Translating our molecular simulation results of the uniquely active behavior of the HER3 kinase into a physiologically relevant our HER3 signaling model demonstrates that even a weak level of HER3 activity may be sufficient to induce AKT signaling and TKI resistance in the context of an ErbB signaling-dependent tumor and therefore therapeutic targeting of HER3 may represent a superior treatment strategy for specific ErbB-driven cancers.

The simultaneous utilization of efficient respiration and inefficient fermentation even in the presence of abundant oxygen is a puzzling phenomenon commonly observed in and cancer cells. Despite extensive the biochemical basis for this phenomenon remains obscure. We hypothesize that the outcome of a competition for membrane space between glucose transporters and respiratory chain we refer to as economics of membrane proteins influences respiration and fermentation. By incorporating a sole constraint based on this concept in the genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia we were able to simulate respiro-fermentation. Further analysis of the impact this constraint revealed differential utilization of the cytochromes and faster glucose uptake under anaerobic conditions than under aerobic conditions. Based on these we propose that bacterial cells manage the composition of their cytoplasmic membrane to maintain optimal ATP production by switching between oxidative and substrate-level phosphorylation. These results suggest that the membrane occupancy constraint may be a fundamental governing constraint of cellular metabolism and establishes a direct link between cell morphology and physiology.

Here we present a genome-scale metabolic network model for R. sphaeroides strain designated consisting of metabolites and including R. sphaeroides-specific biomass reactions developed in this study. Constraint-based analysis showed that iRsp1095 agreed well with experimental observations when modeling growth under respiratory and phototrophic conditions. Genes essential for phototrophic growth were predicted by single gene deletion analysis. During pathway-level analyses of R. sphaeroides an alternative route for CO2 assimilation was identified. Evaluation of photoheterotrophic H2 production using iRsp1095 indicated that maximal yield would be obtained from growing with this predicted maximum higher than that observed experimentally from wild type cells. Competing pathways that might prevent the achievement of this theoretical maximum were identified to guide future genetic studies. iRsp1095 provides a robust framework for future metabolic engineering efforts to optimize the solar- and nutrient-powered production of biofuels and other valuable products by R. sphaeroides and closely related organisms.

Kiselyov Versteyhe Gauguin De Meyts P. Mol Syst Biol. The insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors activate overlapping signalling pathways that are critical for survival and longevity. Their mechanism of ligand binding and activation displays complex allosteric which no mathematical model has been able to account for. Modelling these binding and activation in terms of interactions between the molecular components is problematical due to many unknown biochemical and structural details. substantial combinatorial complexity originating from multivalent ligand binding further complicates the problem. On basis of the available structural and biochemical we develop a physically plausible model of the receptor binding and which is based on the concept of a harmonic oscillator. Modelling a network of interactions among all possible receptor intermediaries arising in the context of model for the insulin accurately reproduces for the first time all the kinetic properties of the and provides unique robust estimates of the kinetic parameters. The harmonic oscillator model may be adaptable for many other receptor tyrosine cytokine receptors and G-protein-coupled where ligand crosslinking occurs.

A new molecular mathematical model is developed by considering the kinetics of and the process of glucose mobilization by glycogen phosphorylase and synthase in the dynamics of insulin signaling pathway. The new model can qualitatively reproduce the experimental glucose and insulin data. It also enables us to use the Bendixson criterion about the existence of periodic orbits a two-dimensional dynamical system to mathematically predict that the oscillations of glucose and insulin are not caused by instead they would be caused by the mechanism of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore it enables us to conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that both glucose and insulin are most sensitive to the rate constant for conversion of to the multiplicative factor modulating the rate constant for conversion of to the multiplicative factor that modulates insulin receptor dephosphorylation and the maximum velocity of GLUT4. the sensitivity analysis predicts that an increase of the apparent velocity of a combination elevated mobilization rate of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and an extended duration of GLUT4 on the plasma will result in a decrease the needs of plasma insulin. On the other an increase of the GLUT4 internalization rate results in an elevated demand of insulin to stimulate the mobilization of GLUT4 from the intracellular store to the plasma membrane.

Farhy McCall AL. Methods Enzymol. Glucagon counterregulation is a key protection against hypoglycemia compromised in insulinopenic diabetes by an unknown mechanism. In this we present an interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of GCR control mechanisms. Our results indicate that a pancreatic network which unifies a few explicit interactions between the major islet peptides and blood glucose can replicate the normal GCR axis and explain its impairment in diabetes. A key and novel component of this network is an alpha-cell which drives glucagon pulsatility and mediates triggering of pulsatile GCR by hypoglycemia via a switch-off of the beta-cell suppression of the alpha-cells. We have performed simulations based on our models of the endocrine pancreas which explain the in vivo GCR response to hypoglycemia of the normal pancreas and the enhancement of defective pulsatile GCR in beta-cell deficiency by switch-off of intrapancreatic alpha-cell suppressing signals. The models also predicted that reduced insulin secretion decreases and delays the GCR. In based on experimental data we have developed and validated a model of the normal GCR control mechanisms and their dysregulation in insulin deficient diabetes. One advantage of this construct is that all model components are clinically thereby permitting its and application to the study of GCR abnormalities the human endocrine pancreas in vivo.

De Gaetano Hardy Beck Abu-Raddad Palumbo Bue-Valleskey Porksen N. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. Few attempts have been made to model mathematically the progression of type diabetes. A realistic representation of the long-term physiological adaptation to developing insulin resistance is necessary for effectively designing clinical trials and evaluating diabetes prevention or disease modification therapies. Writing a good model for diabetes progression is difficult because the long time span of the disease makes experimental verification of modeling hypotheses extremely awkward. In this it is of primary importance that the assumptions underlying model equations properly reflect established physiology and that the mathematical formulation of the model give rise only to physically plausible behavior of the solutions. In present a model of the pancreatic islet compensation is its physiological assumptions are some fundamental qualitative characteristics of its solutions are the numerical values assigned to its parameters are extensively discussed with reference to available cross-sectional epidemiologic and its performance over the span of a lifetime is simulated under various including worsening insulin resistance and primary replication defects. The differences with respect to two previously proposed models of diabetes progression are and the model is proposed as a robust description of the evolution compensation of the glucose-insulin system in healthy and diabetic individuals.

An integrated model for the regulation of glucose and insulin concentrations following intravenous glucose provocations in healthy volunteers and type diabetic patients was developed. Data from individuals were included. Total labeled and insulin concentrations were determined. Simultaneous analysis of all data by nonlinear mixed effect modeling was performed in NONMEM. Integrated models for labeled and insulin were developed. Control mechanisms for regulation of glucose insulin and uptake were incorporated. Physiologically relevant differences between healthy volunteers and patients were identified in the regulation of glucose elimination rate of and secretion insulin. The model was able to describe the insulin and glucose profiles well and also showed a good ability to simulate data. The features of the present model are likely to be of interest for analysis of data collected in antidiabetic drug development and for optimization of study design.

Cui Kaandorp Lloyd CM. BMC Syst Biol Oct The zinc homeostasis system in Escherichia coli is one of the most intensively studied prokaryotic zinc homeostasis systems. Its underlying regulatory machine consists of repression on zinc influx through ZnuABC by Zur uptake and activation on zinc efflux via ZntA by ZntR zinc-responsive Although these transcriptional regulations seem to be well and there is an abundance of detailed in vitro experimental data as yet there is no mathematical model to help interpret these data. To our the work described here is the first attempt to use a mathematical model to simulate these regulatory relations and to help explain the in vitro experimental data. We develop a unified mathematical model consisting of reactions to simulate the in vitro transcriptional response of the zinc homeostasis system in E. coli. we simulate the in vitro Zur-DNA interaction by using two of these which are expressed as ordinary differential equations By imposing the conservation restraints and solving the relevant steady state we find that the simulated sigmoidal curve matches the corresponding experimental data. by numerically solving the ODEs for simulating the Zur and ZntR run-off transcription and depicting the simulated concentrations of zntA and znuC transcripts as a function of free zinc we find that the simulated curves fit the corresponding in vitro experimental data. we also perform after taking into consideration the competitive effects of ZntR with the zinc and depict the simulated concentration of zntA transcripts as a function of the total ZntR both in the presence and absence of The obtained simulation results are in general agreement with the corresponding experimental data. Simulation results show that our model can quantitatively reproduce the results of several the in vitro experiments conducted by Outten CE and her colleagues.

The yeast pheromone pathway has been extensively and is an ideal system for studying transcriptional regulation. Here we combine computational and experimental approaches to study transcriptional regulation mediated by the key transcription factor in the pheromone response. Our mathematical model is able to explain multiple counterintuitive experimental results and led to several novel findings. we found that the transcriptional repressors Dig1 and Dig2 positively affect transcription by stabilizing Ste12. This stabilization through protein-protein interactions creates a large pool of Ste12 that is rapidly activated following pheromone stimulation. we found that protein degradation follows saturating explaining the long half-life of Ste12 in mutants expressing elevated amounts of Ste12. our model reveals a novel mechanism for robust perfect adaptation through protein-protein interactions that enhance complex stability.

The relevant genes in plants show pronounced daily regulation. Their temporal RNA expression do not predict the dynamics of metabolite due to the divergence of enzyme activity from the RNA profiles.Unicellular phytoplankton retains the complexity of plant carbohydrate and recent transcriptomic profiling suggests a major input of transcriptional regulation.

Measured RNA expression datasets from microarray analysis were integrated with a detailed stoichiometric reconstruction of starch metabolism in O. tauri order to predict the optimal flux distribution and the dynamics of starch content in the cycle. The predicted starch profile was validated by experimental data over the h cycle. The main genetic regulatory targets within the pathway were predicted by in silico analysis.

Sarma Ghosh I. BMC Syst Biol. Jul The three layer mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascade exhibits different designs of interactions between its kinases and phosphatases. While the sequential interactions between the three kinases of the cascade are tightly the phosphatases of such as MKP3 and exhibit relatively diverse interactions with their substrate kinases. the kinases of MAPK cascade can also sequester their phosphatases. each topologically distinct interaction design of kinases and phosphatases could exhibit unique signal processing and the presence of phosphatase sequestration may lead to further fine tuning of the propagated signal. We have built four models of the MAPK each model with identical kinase-kinase interactions but unique kinases-phosphatases interactions. Our simulations unravelled that MAPK robustness to external perturbations is a function of nature interaction between its kinases and phosphatases. The output robustness was enhanced when phosphatases were sequestrated by their target kinases. We uncovered a novel negative feedback loop from the phosphatase MKP3 to its upstream kinase in a cascade resembling the B cell MAPK cascade. strength of the feedback loop was reciprocal to the strength of sequestration and stronger abolished the feedback loop completely. An experimental method to verify the presence of feedback loop is also proposed. We further when the models were activated by transient memory time taken by the cascade output to reach its unstimulated level after removal of a cascade was determined by the specific designs of interaction among its kinases and phosphatases. Differences in interaction designs among the kinases and phosphatases can differentially shape the robustness and signal response behaviour of the MAPK cascade and phosphatase sequestration dramatically enhances the robustness to perturbations in each of the cascade. An implicit negative feedback loop was uncovered from our analysis and we found that strength of the negative feedback loop is reciprocally related to the strength of phosphatase sequestration. Duration of output phosphorylation in response to a transient signal was also found to be determined by the individual kinase-phosphatase interaction design.

Aug The search for new drug targets for antibiotics against Plasmodium a major cause of human is a pressing scientific as multiple resistance strains spread rapidly. Metabolic network-based analyses may help to identify those essential enzymes whose homologous counterparts in the human host cells are either non-essential or relatively less essential. Using the well-curated metabolic networks PlasmoNet of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and HepatoNet1 of the human selectivity of experimental antimalarial drug targets was analyzed. Applying in silico gene of these drug targets were found to be perfectly in that they were essential for the parasite but non-essential for the human cell.

Jun The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway has recently been shown to play an important role in the innate immune response to viral infection with host protection occurring through a coordinate down regulation of the enzymes catalysing each metabolic step. In statin based which form the principle pharmaceutical agents for decreasing the activity of this target a single enzyme. we build an ordinary differential equation model of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in order to investigate how the two regulatory strategies impact upon the behaviour of pathway. We employ a modest set of that the pathway operates away from that each metabolite is involved in multiple cellular interactions and that mRNA levels reflect enzyme concentrations. Using data taken from primary bone marrow derived macrophage cells infected with murine cytomegalovirus or treated with we show under these coordinate down-regulation of enzyme activity imparts a graduated reduction in flux along the pathway. In modelling a statin-like treatment that achieves the same degree of down-regulation in cholesterol we show that this delivers a step change in flux along the pathway. The graduated reduction mediated by physiological coordinate regulation of multiple enzymes supports a mechanism that allows a greater level of altering cholesterol levels with less impact upon interactions branching from the than pharmacological step reductions. We argue that coordinate regulation is likely to show a long-term evolutionary advantage over single enzyme regulation. the results from our models have implications for future pharmaceutical therapies intended to target cholesterol production with greater specificity and fewer off target suggesting that this can be achieved by mimicking the coordinated down-regulation observed in immunological responses.","origin":"BioModels","curated":"No"},{"id":"MODEL1208030000","title":"Mandlik2013 - Synthetic circuit of IPC synthase in Leishmania","body":"Mandlik2012 Synthetic circuit of IPC synthase in Leishmania A genetic circuit for the targeted enzyme inositol phosphorylceramide synthase belonging to the protozoan parasite Leishmania is constructed by Mandlik et al.

Integrin signaling regulates cell migration and plays a pivotal role in developmental processes and cancer metastasis. Integrin signaling has been studied extensively and much data is available on pathway components and interactions. Yet the data is fragmented and an integrated model is missing. We use a rule-based modeling approach to integrate available data and test biological hypotheses regarding the role of Dok1 and PIPKI in integrin activation. The detailed biochemical characterization of integrin signaling provides us with measured values for most of the kinetics parameters. measurements are not fully accurate and the cellular concentrations of signaling proteins are largely unknown and expected to vary substantially across different cellular conditions. By sampling model behaviors over the physiologically realistic parameter range we find that the model exhibits only two different qualitative behaviors and these depend mainly on the relative protein which offers a powerful point of control to the cell.

This update maintains an emphasis on standards unambiguous metabolite and computer-readable annotations available through a structured document format. we have developed MATLAB scripts to evaluate the predictive accuracy and to demonstrate basic model applications such as simulating aerobic and anaerobic growth. These which provide an independent tool for evaluating the performance of various stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic models using flux balance are included as Additional files and Yeast expands refines the computational reconstruction of yeast metabolism and improves the predictive accuracy of a stoichiometrically constrained yeast metabolic model.

To elucidate the potential contribution of the liver to hypoglycemia in T2DM we applied a detailed kinetic model of human hepatic glucose metabolism to simulate changes in and glycogen metabolism induced by deviations of the hormones and epinephrine from their normal plasma profiles. Our simulations reveal in line with experimental and clinical data from a multitude of studies in significant changes the relative contribution of and glycogen metabolism to hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose decreased postprandial glycogen storage as well increased glycogen depletion in overnight fasting and short term a shift of the set point defining the switch between hepatic glucose production and hepatic glucose utilization to elevated plasma glucose in T2DM relative to healthy subjects. our model simulations predict a restricted gluconeogenic response of the liver under impaired hormonal signals observed in resulting an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The inability of hepatic glucose metabolism to effectively counterbalance a decline of the blood glucose level becomes even more pronounced in case of tightly controlled insulin treatment.

Aug Availability of oxygen and nutrients in the coronary circulation is a crucial determinant of cardiac performance. Nutrient composition of coronary blood may significantly vary in specific physiological and pathological for administration of special long-term physical exercise or diabetes. Quantitative analysis of cardiac metabolism from a systems biology perspective may help to a better understanding of the relationship between nutrient supply and efficiency of metabolic processes required for an adequate cardiac output. Here we present the first large-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network of the human cardiomyocyte comprising metabolic including transport processes in six compartments. We use flux-balance analysis to demonstrate the capability of network to accomplish a set of metabolic functions required for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the cell.

Iterating hypothesis experimental and model we accurately curated the network and quantitatively explored the energy metabolism. In contrast to other M. pneumoniae uses most of its energy for maintenance tasks instead of growth. We show that in highly linear networks the prediction of flux distributions for different growth times allows analysis of time-dependent albeit using a static model. By performing an in silico knock-out study as well analyzing flux distributions in single and double mutant we demonstrated that the model accurately represents the metabolism of M. pneumoniae.

PLoS One. May The diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes mitosis in glucose-rich medium but enters meiosis in acetate sporulation medium. The transition from mitosis to meiosis involves a remarkable adaptation of the metabolic machinery to the changing environment to meet new energy and biosynthesis requirements. Biochemical studies indicate that five metabolic pathways are active at different stages of glutamate tricarboxylic acid glyoxylate and glycogenolysis. A dynamic synthesis of including amino and is also observed. the metabolic requirements of sporulating cells are poorly understood. In this we apply flux balance analyses to uncover optimal principles driving the operation of metabolic networks over the entire period of sporulation.

By systematically evaluating the correlation between computational and experimental fluxes on pathways and macromolecule the metabolic requirements of cells are sporulation requires maximization of ATP production and macromolecule syntheses in the early phase followed by maximization of carbohydrate breakdown and minimization of ATP production in the middle and late stages. Our computational models are validated by in silico deletion of enzymes known to be essential for sporulation. the models are used to predict novel metabolic genes required for sporulation. This study indicates that yeast cells have distinct metabolic requirements at different phases of which may reflect regulation that realizes the optimal outcome of sporulation. Our meiosis-specific network models provide a framework for an in-depth understanding of the roles enzymes and may open new avenues for engineering metabolic pathways to improve sporulation efficiency.

Chavez Bais Vingron Lehrach Adjaye Herwig R BMC The transcription factor OCT4 is highly expressed in pluripotent embryonic stem cells which are derived from the inner cell mass of mammalian blastocysts. Pluripotency and self renewal are controlled by a transcription regulatory network governed by the transcription factors SOX2 and NANOG. Recent studies on reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells highlight OCT4 as a key regulator of pluripotency. We have carried out an integrated analysis of high-throughput data and RNAi experiments along with promoter sequence analysis of putative target and identified a core OCT4 regulatory network in human embryonic stem cells consisting of target genes. Enrichment analysis with these target genes revealed that this integrative analysis increases the functional information content by factors of compared to the individual studies. In order to identify potential regulatory co-factors of we performed a de novo motif analysis. In addition to known validated OCT4 motifs we obtained binding sites similar to motifs recognized by further regulators of pluripotency and e.g. the heterodimer of transcription factors C-MYC and a prerequisite for C-MYC transcriptional activity that leads to cell growth and proliferation. Our analysis shows how heterogeneous functional information can be integrated in order to reconstruct gene regulatory networks. As a test case we identified a core OCT4-regulated network that is important for the analysis of stem cell characteristics and cellular differentiation. Functional information is largely enriched using different experimental results. The de novo motif discovery identified well-known regulators closely connected to the OCT4 network as well potential new regulators of pluripotency and differentiation. These results provide the basis for further targeted functional studies.

The relevant regulatory roles of the short half-life enzymes ornithine decarboxylase S-adenosyl methione and acetyl transferase in polyamine metabolism are well and has been modelled here. This model is described in the A combined model of hepatic polyamine and sulfur amino acid metabolism to analyze S-adenosyl methionine availability. Reyes-Palomares Montañez Sánchez-Jiménez Medina MA Amino February Volume Issue pp Many molecular details remain to be uncovered concerning the regulation of polyamine metabolism. A previous model of mammalian polyamine metabolism showed that S-adenosyl methionine availability could play a key role in polyamine homeostasis. To get a deeper insight in this we have built a combined model by integration of the previously published polyamine model and one-carbon glutathione metabolism published by different research groups. The combined model is robust and it is able to achieve physiological steady-state as well to reproduce the predictions of individual models. a transition between two versions of our model with new regulatory factors added properly simulates the switch in methionine adenosyl transferase isozymes occurring when the liver enters in proliferative conditions. The combined model is useful to support the previous prediction on the role of S-adenosyl methionine availability in polyamine homeostasis. it could be easily adapted to get deeper insights on the connections of polyamines with energy metabolism.

This model is described in the Swimming a large-scale computational analysis of the metabolism Dinoroseobacter shibae. Rex Bill Schmidt-Hohagen Schomburg D. PLoS Comput Biol. The Roseobacter clade is a ubiquitous group of marine α-proteobacteria. To gain insight into the versatile metabolism of this we took a constraint-based approach and created a genome-scale metabolic model of Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12T. Our model is the first accounting for the energy demand of the light-driven ATP generation and experimentally determined specific biomass composition. To cover a large variety of environmental as well plasmid and single gene knock-out we simulated different physiological states using flux balance analysis. We analyzed our results with regard to energy validated them and revealed a pronounced metabolic response to the availability of light. we introduced the energy demand of motility as an important parameter in genome-scale metabolic models. The results of our simulations also gave insight into the changing usage of the two degradation routes for an abundant compound in the ocean. A side product of dimethylsulfoniopropionate degradation is dimethyl which seeds cloud formation and thus enhances the reflection of sunlight. By our exhaustive we were able to identify single-gene knock-out which show an increased production of dimethyl sulfide. In addition to the single-gene knock-out simulations we studied the effect of plasmid loss on the metabolism. we explored the possible use of a functioning phosphofructokinase for D. shibae.

This model is described in the Genome-scale metabolic model for Lactococcus lactis MG1363 and its application to the analysis of flavor formation. Flahaut Wiersma van de Bunt Martens Schaap Sijtsma Dos Santos de Vos WM Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology. Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363 is a paradigm strain for lactococci used in industrial dairy fermentations. despite of its importance for process no genome-scale metabolic model has been reported thus far. current models for other lactococci only focus on growth and sugar degradation. A metabolic model that includes nitrogen metabolism and flavor-forming pathways is instrumental for the understanding and designing new industrial applications of these lactic acid bacteria. A constraint-based model of the metabolism and transport in L. lactis accounting for and was developed experimentally validated. Fifty-nine reactions are directly or indirectly involved in flavor formation. Flux Balance Analysis and Flux Variability Analysis were used to investigate flux distributions within the whole metabolic network. Anaerobic carbon-limited continuous cultures were used for estimating the energetic parameters. A thorough model-driven analysis showing a highly flexible nitrogen branched-chain amino acid catabolism which coupled with the redox is pivotal for the prediction of formation different flavor compounds. the model predicted formation of volatile sulfur compounds as a result of the fermentation. These products were subsequently identified in the experimental fermentations carried out. the genome-scale metabolic model couples the carbon and nitrogen metabolism in L. lactis MG1363 with complete known catabolic pathways leading to flavor formation. The model provided valuable insights into the metabolic networks underlying flavor formation and has the potential to contribute new developments in dairy industries and cheese-flavor research.

Wollbold Jaster Müller Rateitschak Wolkenhauer O. BMC Syst Biol BackgroundRecent findings suggest that in pancreatic acinar cells stimulated with bile a pro-apoptotic effect of reactive oxygen species dominates their effect on necrosis and spreading of inflammation. The first effect presumably occurs via cytochrome C release from the inner mitochondrial membrane. A pro-necrotic effect similar to the one of can be strong opening of mitochondrial pores leading to breakdown of the membrane ATP sustained increase and premature activation of digestive enzymes. To explain published data and to understand ROS effects during the onset of acute a model using multi-valued logic is constructed. Formal concept analysis is used to validate the model against data as well to analyze and visualize rules that capture the dynamics.ResultsSimulations for two different levels of bile stimulation and for inhibition or addition of antioxidants reproduce the qualitative behaviour shown in the experiments. Based on reported differences of ROS production and of ROS induced pore the model predicts a more uniform ratio for higher and lower bile stimulation in liver cells than in pancreatic acinar cells. FCA confirms that essential dynamical features of the data are captured by the model. For high necrosis always occurs together with at least a medium level of apoptosis. At the same FCA helps to reveal subtle differences between data and simulations. The FCA visualization underlines the protective role of ROS against necrosis.ConclusionsThe analysis of the model demonstrates how ROS and decreased antioxidant levels contribute to apoptosis. Studying the induction of necrosis via a sustained we implemented the commonly accepted hypothesis of ATP depletion after strong bile stimulation. Using an alternative we demonstrate that this process is not necessary to generate the dynamics of measured variables. Opening of plasma membrane channels could also lead to a prolonged increase of and to necrosis. the analysis of model suggests a direct experimental testing for the model-based hypothesis of a self-enhancing cycle of cytochrome C release and ROS production by interruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

This accumulation of has been related to its faulty cerebral clearance. preclinical studies that used mice to investigate clearance showed that efflux across blood-brain barrier and brain degradation mediate efficient clearance. the contribution of each process to clearance remains unclear. it is still uncertain how species differences between mouse and human could affect clearance. a modified form of the brain efflux index method was used to estimate the contribution of BBB and brain degradation to clearance from the brain of wild type mice. We estimated that of intracerebrally injected is cleared across BBB while is cleared by brain degradation. in vitro and silico studies were performed to compare clearance between mouse and human BBB models. Kinetic studies for disposition in bEnd3 and representative in vitro mouse and human BBB demonstrated 30-fold higher rate of uptake and 15-fold higher rate of degradation by bEnd3 compared to cells. Expression studies showed both cells to express different levels of P-glycoprotein and while LRP1 levels were comparable. we established a mechanistic which could successfully predict cellular levels of and the rate of each process. Established mechanistic model suggested significantly higher rates of uptake and degradation in bEnd3 cells as rationale for the observed differences in disposition between mouse and human BBB models.

Tiveci Akin Cakir Saybaşili Ulgen K. Comput Biol Chem Functional imaging techniques play a major role in the study of brain activation by monitoring the changes in blood flow and energy metabolism. In order to interpret functional neuroimaging data the existing mathematical models describing the links that may exist between electrical energy metabolism and hemodynamics in literature are thoroughly analyzed for their advantages and disadvantages in terms of their prediction available experimental data. these models are combined within a single model that includes membrane ionic mitochondrial exchanges through the blood-brain as well brain hemodynamics. Particular attention is paid to the transport and storage of calcium ions in neurons since calcium is not only an important molecule for signalling in but it is also essential for memory storage. Multiple efforts have underlined the importance of calcium dependent cellular processes in the biochemical characterization of disease suggesting that abnormalities in calcium homeostasis might be involved in the pathophysiology of disease. The ultimate goal of this study is to investigate the hypotheses about physiological or biochemical changes in health and disease to correlate them measurable physiological parameters obtained from functional neuroimaging data as in the time course of blood oxygenation level dependent signal. When calcium dynamics are included in the both BOLD signal and metabolite concentration profiles are shown to exhibit temporal behaviour consistent with the experimental data found in literature.

Deregulation of energy mostly through the loss of complex I is involved in disease progression both the genetic and sporadic forms of the disease. In this we investigated energy deregulation in the cerebral tissue of animal models and toxin of PD using an approach that combines metabolomics and mathematical modelling. In a first quantitative measurements of energy-related metabolites in mouse brain slices revealed most affected pathways. A genetic model of the Park2 was compared to the effect of a complex I blocker. Model simulated and experimental results revealed a significant and sustained decrease in ATP after CCCP but not in the genetic mice model. In support to data a mathematical model of the relevant metabolic pathways was developed and calibrated onto experimental data. In this we show that a short-term stress response in nucleotide scavenging is most probably induced by the toxin exposure.

Here we address this question using a theoretical kinetic model to calculate the growth rate of protein aggregates as a function of the dose each of three categories drug. We find that therapeutics which block the growing ends of amyloids are the most as alternative strategies may be ineffective or even accelerate amyloid formation at low drug concentrations.

Aubert Costalat R. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. Understanding cerebral energy metabolism in neurons and astrocytes is necessary for the interpretation of functional brain imaging data. It has been suggested that astrocytes can provide lactate as an energy fuel to a process referred to as astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle Some authors challenged this defending the classical view that glucose is the major energy substrate of at rest as well in response to a stimulation. To test the ANLS hypothesis from a theoretical point of we developed a mathematical model of compartmentalized energy metabolism between neurons and adopting hypotheses highly unfavorable to ANLS. Simulation results can be divided between two depending on the relative neuron versus astrocyte stimulation. If this ratio is ANLS observed during all the stimulus and poststimulus periods but a high ratio induces ANLS only at the beginning of stimulus and during the poststimulus period our results show that current experimental data on lactate kinetics are compatible with the ANLS and that it is essential to assess the neuronal and astrocytic ratio changes to test the ANLS hypothesis.

Dysfunction in various dopaminergic systems is known to be associated with various including and syndrome. microdialysis studies have shown that addictive drugs increase extracellular dopamine and brain imaging has shown a correlation between euphoria and psycho-stimulant-induced increases in extracellular dopamine These consequences of dopamine dysfunction indicate the importance of maintaining dopamine functionality through homeostatic mechanisms that have been attributed to the delicate balance between and reuptake. We construct a mathematical model of dopamine and reuptake use it to study homeostasis in single dopaminergic neuron terminals. We investigate the substrate inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by the consequences of rapid uptake extracellular dopamine by the and effects of the autoreceoptors on dopaminergic function. The main focus is to understand the regulation and control of synthesis and release to explicate and interpret experimental findings. We show that the substrate inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase by stabilizes cytosolic and vesicular dopamine against changes in tyrosine availability due to meals. We find that the autoreceptors dampen fluctuations in extracellular dopamine caused by changes in tyrosine hydroxylase expression and changes in the rate of firing. We show that short bursts of action potentials create significant dopamine signals against the background of tonic firing. We explain the observed time courses of extracellular dopamine responses to stimulation in wild type mice and that have genetically altered dopamine transporter densities and the observed half-lives of extracellular dopamine under various treatment protocols. Dopaminergic systems must respond robustly to important biological signals such as while at the same time maintaining homeostasis in the face of normal biological fluctuations in expression and firing rates. This is accomplished through the cooperative effect of many different homeostatic mechanisms including special properties of tyrosine the dopamine and autoreceptors.

Performing MFA using Recon without any modification would have implied that cells have access to all functionality encoded by the which is not realistic. The majority of intracellular fluxes are poorly determined as only extracellular exchange rates are measured. This is compounded by the fact that there is no suitable metabolic objective function to suppress non-specific fluxes.

This implies that cells would engage these dominant metabolic pathways to and any significant changes in gross metabolic phenotypes would have invoked changes in these pathways.

Recent studies have shown that cholesterol levels in both the plasma and brain may play a role in disease this exact role is not well understood. Additional proteins of interest have also been identified as possible contributors to AD pathogenesis. To help understand these roles a systems biology mathematical model was developed. Basic principles from graph theory and control analysis were used to study the effect of altered LRP and APP on the system as a whole. Negative feedback regulation and the rate of cholesterol transfer between astrocytes and neurons were identified as key modulators in the level of beta amyloid. Experiments were run concurrently to test whether decreasing plasma and brain cholesterol levels with simvastatin altered the expression levels of beta and to ascertain the edge directions in the network model and to better understand whether statin treatment served as a viable treatment option for AD patients.

This model is described in the SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY. Emergent genetic oscillations in a synthetic microbial consortium. Chen Kim Hirning Josić Bennett MR. Science. Aug A challenge of synthetic biology is the creation of cooperative microbial systems that exhibit population-level behaviors. Such systems use cellular signaling mechanisms to regulate gene expression across multiple cell types. We describe the construction of a synthetic microbial consortium consisting of two distinct cell strain and a strain. These strains produced two orthogonal cell-signaling molecules that regulate gene expression within a synthetic circuit spanning both strains. The two strains generated population-level oscillations only when cultured together. Certain network topologies of the two-strain circuit were better at maintaining robust oscillations than others. The ability to program population-level dynamics through the genetic engineering of multiple cooperative strains points the way toward engineering complex synthetic tissues and organs with multiple cell types.

Evaluation of the rates proton production and consumption in the extracellular and cytoplasmic compartments revealed that energy conservation with extracellular electron such as was limited relative to that associated with intracellular acceptors. This limitation was attributed to lack of cytoplasmic proton consumption during reduction of extracellular electron acceptors. Model-based analysis of the metabolic cost of producing an extracellular electron shuttle to promote electron transfer to insoluble oxides demonstrated why Geobacter which do not produce have an energetic advantage over shuttle-producing reducers in subsurface environments. In silico analysis also revealed that the metabolic network of G. sulfurreducens could synthesize amino acids more efficiently than that of Escherichia coli due to the presence of a pyruvate-ferredoxin which catalyzes synthesis of pyruvate from acetate and carbon dioxide in a single step. In silico phenotypic analysis of deletion mutants demonstrated the capability of model to explore the flexibility of G. sulfurreducens central metabolism and correctly predict mutant phenotypes.

BMC Syst Biol Geobacter metallireducens was the first organism that can be grown in pure culture to completely oxidize organic compounds with oxide serving as electron acceptor. Geobacter including G. sulfurreducens and are used for bioremediation and electricity generation from waste organic matter and renewable biomass. The constraint-based modeling approach enables the development of genome-scale in silico models that can predict the behavior of complex biological systems and their responses to the environments. Such a modeling approach was applied to provide physiological and ecological insights on the metabolism of G. metallireducens. The genome-scale metabolic model of G. metallireducens was constructed to include genes and reactions. Compared to the G. sulfurreducens metallireducens metabolic model contains unique reactions that reflect many of G. specific metabolic capabilities. Detailed examination of the G. metallireducens model suggests that its central metabolism contains several energy-inefficient reactions that are not present in the G. sulfurreducens model. Experimental biomass yield of G. metallireducens growing on pyruvate was lower than the predicted optimal biomass yield. Microarray data of G. metallireducens growing with benzoate and acetate indicated that genes encoding these energy-inefficient reactions were up-regulated by benzoate. These results suggested that the energy-inefficient reactions were likely turned off during G. metallireducens growth with acetate for optimal biomass but were up-regulated during growth with complex electron donors such as benzoate for rapid energy generation. several computational modeling approaches were applied to accelerate G. metallireducens research. For growth of G. metallireducens with different electron donors and acceptors were studied using the genome-scale metabolic which provided a fast and cost-effective way to understand the metabolism of G. metallireducens.

BMC Syst Biol Francisella tularensis is a prototypic example of a pathogen for which few experimental datasets but for which copious high-throughout data are becoming available because of its re-emerging significance as biothreat agent. The virulence of Francisella tularensis depends on its growth capabilities within a defined environmental niche of the host cell. We reconstructed the metabolism of Francisella as a stoichiometric matrix. This systems biology approach demonstrated that changes in carbohydrate utilization and amino acid metabolism play a pivotal role in acid and energy homeostasis during infection with Francisella. We also show how varying the expression of certain metabolic genes in different environments efficiently controls the metabolic capacity of F. tularensis. Selective gene-expression analysis showed modulation of sugar catabolism by switching from oxidative metabolism in the initial stages of infection to fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis later on. Computational analysis with constraints derived from experimental data revealed a limited set of metabolic genes that are operational during infection.

Roberts Gowen Brooks Fong SS. BMC Syst Biol Microorganisms possess diverse metabolic capabilities that can potentially be leveraged for efficient production of biofuels. Clostridium thermocellum is a thermophilic anaerobe that is both cellulolytic and meaning that it can directly use the plant and biochemically convert it to ethanol. A major challenge in using microorganisms for chemical production is the need to modify the organism to increase production efficiency. The process of properly engineering an organism is typically arduous. Here we present a genome-scale model of C. thermocellum for the purpose of establishing a computational tool to study the metabolic network of C. thermocellum and facilitate efforts to engineer C. thermocellum for biofuel production. The model consists of reactions involving intracellular and a proteomic-based representation of a cellulosome. The process of constructing this metabolic model led to suggested annotation refinements for genes and identification of areas metabolism requiring further study. The accuracy of the iSR432 model was tested using experimental growth and by-product secretion data for growth on cellobiose and fructose. Analysis using this model captures the relationship between reduction-oxidation state of the cell and ethanol secretion allowed for prediction of gene deletions and environmental conditions that would increase ethanol production. By incorporating genomic sequence network and experimental measurements of enzyme activities and metabolite we have generated a model that is reasonably accurate at predicting the cellular phenotype of C. thermocellum and establish a strong foundation for rational strain design. In we are able to draw some important conclusions regarding the underlying metabolic mechanisms for observed behaviors of C. thermocellum and highlight remaining gaps in the existing genome annotations.

Here we have explored the underlying reorganization of the metabolome by combining computational predictions based on constraint-based modeling and detailed transcriptomics time course observations. We reconstructed the stoichiometric matrix of S. including the major antibiotic biosynthesis and performed flux balance analysis to predict flux changes that occur when the cell switches from biomass to antibiotic production. We defined the model input based on observed fermenter culture data and used a dynamically varying objective function to represent the metabolic switch. The predicted fluxes of many genes show highly significant correlation to the time series of the corresponding gene expression data.

E. coli W one of four strains designated as safe for laboratory has not been sequenced. E. coli W is a fast-growing strain and is the only safe strain that can utilize sucrose as a carbon source. Lifecycle analysis has demonstrated that sucrose from sugarcane is a preferred carbon source for industrial bioprocesses. We have sequenced and annotated the genome of E. coli W. The chromosome is bp and encodes ORFs. Two pRK1 and pRK2 are also present. W has unique features relative to other sequenced laboratory strains B and it has a larger genome and belongs to phylogroup B1 rather than A. W also grows on a much broader range of carbon sources than does K-12. A genome-scale reconstruction was developed and validated in order to interrogate metabolic properties. The genome of W is more similar to commensal and pathogenic B1 strains than phylogroup A and therefore has greater utility for comparative analyses with these strains.

In order to expand our limited knowledge about R. the complete genome sequence of this organism was further annotated and then the physiology of R. ferrireducens was investigated with a genome-scale in silico metabolic model and laboratory studies. The iterative modeling and experimental approach unveiled previously unknown physiological including an expanded range of substrates that support such as cellobiose and provided additional insights into important features such as the stoichiometry of electron transport chain and the ability to grow via fumarate dismutation. Further analysis explained why R. ferrireducens is unable to grow via photosynthesis or fermentation of sugars like other members of this genus and uncovered novel genes for benzoate metabolism.

A genome-scale metabolic model of the lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 was constructed based on genomic content and experimental data. The complete model includes and metabolites. Different stoichiometric modeling techniques were used for interpretation of complex fermentation as L. plantarum is adapted to nutrient-rich environments and only grows in media supplemented with vitamins and amino acids. Based on experimental input and output maximal ATP production was estimated and related to growth rate. Optimization of ATP production further identified amino acid catabolic pathways that were not previously associated with free-energy metabolism. Genome-scale elementary flux mode analysis identified potential futile cycles. Flux variability analysis supplemented the elementary mode analysis in identifying parallel e.g. pathways with identical end products but different co-factor usage. Strongly increased flexibility in the metabolic network was observed when strict coupling between catabolic ATP production and anabolic consumption was relaxed. These results illustrate how a genome-scale metabolic model and associated constraint-based modeling techniques can be used to analyze the physiology of growth on a complex medium rather than a minimal salts medium. optimization of biomass formation using the Flux Balance Analysis reported to successfully predict growth rate and by product formation in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces predicted too high biomass yields that were incompatible with the observed lactate production.

Photosynthesis has recently gained considerable attention for its potential role in the development of renewable energy sources. Optimizing photosynthetic organisms for biomass or biofuel production will therefore require a systems understanding of photosynthetic processes. We reconstructed a high-quality genome-scale metabolic network for Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 that describes key photosynthetic processes in mechanistic detail. We performed an exhaustive in silico analysis of the reconstructed photosynthetic process under different light and inorganic carbon conditions as well under genetic perturbations. Our key results include the following. We identified two main states of the photosynthetic a Ci-limited state and a light-limited state. We discovered nine alternative electron flow pathways that assist the photosynthetic linear electron flow in optimizing the photosynthesis performance. A high degree of cooperativity between alternative pathways was found to be critical for optimal autotrophic metabolism. Although pathways with high photosynthetic yield exist for optimizing growth under suboptimal light pathways with low photosynthetic yield guarantee optimal growth under excessive light or Ci limitation. Photorespiration was found to be essential for the optimal photosynthetic clarifying its role in high-light acclimation. an extremely high photosynthetic robustness drives the optimal autotrophic metabolism at the expense of metabolic versatility and robustness.

In order to design a metabolically engineered strain which is capable of producing succinic acid with high yield and it is essential to optimize the whole metabolism at the systems level. in silico modeling and simulation of the genome-scale metabolic network was employed for genome-scale analysis and efficient design of metabolic engineering experiments. The genome-scale metabolic network of M. succiniciproducens consisting of reactions and metabolites was constructed based on reannotation and validation experiments. With the reconstructed network structure and key metabolic characteristics allowing highly efficient production of succinic acid were these include strong PEP branched TCA relative weak pyruvate the lack of glyoxylate and non-PTS for glucose uptake. Constraints-based flux analyses were then carried out under various environmental and genetic conditions to validate the genome-scale metabolic model and to decipher the altered metabolic characteristics. Predictions based on constraints-based flux analysis were mostly in excellent agreement with the experimental data. In silico knockout studies allowed prediction of new metabolic engineering strategies for the enhanced production of succinic acid.

The reconstruction process is a challenging and laborious especially during the stage of manual curation. For the mouse genome-scale metabolic we were able to rapidly reconstruct a compartmentalized model from well-curated metabolic databases online. The prototype model was comprehensive. Apart from minor compound naming and compartmentalization only nine additional reactions without gene associations were added during model curation before the model was able to simulate growth in silico. Further curation led to a metabolic model that consists of genes mapped to with a total of reactions compartmentalized into the cytoplasm and capable of reproducing metabolic functions inferred from literatures.

The model comprises metabolic processes representing approximately of all protein-coding regions. The model was extensively validated against experimental observations and it correctly predicted main physiological properties of the wild-type such as aerobic and anaerobic respiration fermentation. Due to the frequent involvement of S. aureus in hospital-acquired bacterial infections combined with its increasing antibiotic we also investigated the clinically relevant phenotype of small colony variants and found that the model predictions agreed with recent findings of proteome analyses.

A more detailed analysis showed that the biosynthesis of glycans and lipids is rather rigid with respect to circumventing gene which should make these areas particularly interesting for antibiotic development.

Nair Bhalla Hellgren Kotaleski J. PLoS Comput. Biol. e1005080 In reward the integration of NMDA-dependent calcium and dopamine by striatal projection neurons leads to potentiation of corticostriatal synapses through signaling. In order to elicit the calcium and dopamine inputs should arrive in temporal proximity and must follow a specific after order. little is known about the cellular mechanism which enforces these temporal constraints on the signal integration. In this computational we propose that these temporal requirements emerge as a result of the coordinated signaling via two striatal DARPP-32 and ARPP-21. DARPP-32-mediated signaling could implement an input-interval dependent gating via transient PP1 thus enforcing the requirement for temporal proximity. ARPP-21 signaling could impose the additional input-order requirement of calcium and due to its sequestering property when dopamine arrives first. This highlights the possible role of phosphoproteins in the temporal aspects of striatal signal transduction. This model is hosted on BioModels Database and identified MODEL1603270000.

Mukhopadhyay Cordoba Maini van der Merwe Dushek O. PLoS Comput. Biol. e1003004 Receptor phosphorylation is thought to be tightly regulated because phosphorylated receptors initiate signaling cascades leading to cellular activation. The T cell antigen receptor on the surface of T cells is phosphorylated by the kinase Lck and dephosphorylated by the phosphatase CD45 on multiple immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs Lck sequentially phosphorylates ITAMs and a cytosolic binds to phosphorylated ITAMs with differential affinities. The purpose of multiple their sequential and the differential ZAP-70 affinities are unknown. we use a systems model to show that this signaling architecture produces emergent ultrasensitivity resulting in switch-like responses at the scale of individual TCRs. this switch-like response is an emergent so that removal of multiple sequential or differential affinities abolishes the switch. We propose that highly regulated TCR phosphorylation is achieved by an emergent switch-like response and use the systems model to design novel chimeric antigen receptors for therapy.

Combination chemotherapy is standard treatment for pancreatic cancer. current drugs lack efficacy for most and selection evaluation of new combination regimens is empirical and time-consuming. The efficacy of a standard-of-care combined with a pro-apoptotic antagonist of Inhibitor Apoptosis Proteins was investigated in pancreatic cancer cells. PANC-1 cells were treated with gemcitabine birinapant and combinations of the two drugs. Temporal changes in cell cycle and apoptosis were measured. A basic pharmacodynamic model based on cell and a mechanism-based PD model integrating all were developed. The basic PD model indicated that synergistic effects occurred in both cell proliferation and death processes. The mechanism-based model captured key features of drug temporary cell cycle arrest in S phase induced by gemcitabine apoptosis induced by birinapant and prolonged cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis induced by the combination. A drug interaction term Ψ was employed in the models to signify interactions of the combination when data were limited. When more experimental information was Ψ values approaching indicated that specific mechanisms of interactions were captured better. PD modeling identified the potential benefit of combining gemcitabine and characterized the key interaction pathways.

A basic pharmacodynamic model based on cell and a mechanism-based PD model integrating all were developed. The basic PD model indicated that synergistic effects occurred in both cell proliferation and death processes. The mechanism-based model captured key features of drug temporary cell cycle arrest in S phase induced by gemcitabine apoptosis induced by birinapant and prolonged cell cycle arrest and enhanced apoptosis induced by the combination. A drug interaction term Ψ was employed in the models to signify interactions of the combination when data were limited. When more experimental information was Ψ values approaching indicated that specific mechanisms of interactions were captured better. PD modeling identified the potential benefit of combining gemcitabine and characterized the key interaction pathways. An optimal treatment schedule of pretreatment with gemcitabine for h was suggested based on model predictions and was verified experimentally. This approach provides a generalizable modeling platform for exploring combinations of cytostatic and cytotoxic agents in cancer cell culture studies.

Energy conservation in hydrogenotrophic methanogens was long a only within the last decade was it reported that net energy conservation for growth depends on electron bifurcation. In this we focus on Methanococcus a well-studied hydrogenotrophic marine methanogen. To better understand hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and compare it with methylotrophic methanogenesis that utilizes oxidative phosphorylation rather than electron we have built a genome scale metabolic reconstruction that accounts for of the protein-coding genes of M. maripaludis strain S2. Our reconstructed metabolic network uses recent literature to not only represent the central electron bifurcation reaction but also incorporate vital biosynthesis and assimilation including unique cofactor and coenzyme syntheses. We show that our model accurately predicts experimental growth and gene knockout with accuracy and a Matthews correlation coefficient of we use our metabolic network reconstruction to probe the implications of electron bifurcation by showing its as well investigating the infeasibility of aceticlastic methanogenesis in the network. we demonstrate a method of applying thermodynamic constraints to a metabolic model to quickly estimate overall free-energy changes between what comes in and out of the cell. we describe a novel reconstruction-specific computational toolbox we created to improve usability. our results provide a computational network for exploring hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and confirm the importance of electron bifurcation in this process.Understanding and applying hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is a promising avenue for developing new bioenergy technologies around methane gas.

We combine ensemble modeling with experimental investigations to test in quantitative terms different hypotheses about the crosstalk of HOG and the CWI pathways.

In order to generate these oscillations many processes can contribute to properly timing such delay. Here we show that the time delay coming from the transitions between internal states of the cis-regulatory system can drive sustained oscillations in an auto-repressive single-gene circuit operating in a small volume like a cell. We found that the cooperative binding of repressor molecules is not mandatory for a oscillatory behavior if there are enough binding sites in the CRS. These oscillations depend on an adequate balance between the CRS and rates of repressor molecules. This finding suggest that the multi-site CRS architecture can play a key role for oscillatory behavior of gene expression. our results can also help to synthetic biologists on the design of promoters architecture for new genetic oscillatory circuits.

Immune responses to Helicobacter pylori are orchestrated through complex balances of host-bacterial including inflammatory and regulatory immune responses across scales that can lead to the development of gastric disease or the promotion of beneficial systemic effects. While inflammation in response to the bacterium has been reasonably the regulatory pathways that contribute to preventing inflammatory events during H. pylori infection are incompletely understood. To aid in this we have generated a computational model incorporating recent developments in the understanding of H. pylori-host interactions. Sensitivity analysis of this model reveals that a regulatory macrophage population is critical in maintaining high H. pylori colonization without the generation of an inflammatory response. To address how this myeloid cell subset we developed a second model describing an intracellular signaling network for the differentiation of macrophages. Modeling studies predicted that LANCL2 is a central regulator of inflammatory and effector pathways its activation promotes regulatory responses characterized by IL-10 production while suppressing effector responses. The predicted impairment of regulatory macrophage differentiation by the loss of LANCL2 was simulated based on multiscale linkages between the tissue-level gastric mucosa and the intracellular models. The simulated deletion of LANCL2 resulted in a greater clearance of H. but also greater IFNγ responses and damage to the epithelium. The model predictions were validated within a mouse model of H. pylori colonization in wild-type LANCL2 whole body KO and myeloid-specific which displayed similar decreases in H. pylori IL-10-producing and type regulatory T cells. This study shows the importance of LANCL2 in the induction of regulatory responses in macrophages and T cells during H. pylori infection.","origin":"BioModels","curated":"No"},{"id":"MODEL1611180000","title":"Verlingue2016 - Signalling pathway that control S-phase entry and geroconversion - Boolean Model","body":"Verlingue2016 Signalling pathway that control S-phase entry and geroconversion Boolean Model This model is described in the A comprehensive approach to the molecular determinants of lifespan using a Boolean model of geroconversion. Verlingue Dugourd Stoll Barillot Calzone Londoño-Vallejo A. Aging Cell Altered molecular responses to insulin and growth factors are responsible for late-life shortening diseases such as type-2 diabetes mellitus and cancers. We have built a network of the signaling pathways that control S-phase entry and a specific type of senescence called geroconversion. We have translated this network into a Boolean model to study possible cell phenotype outcomes under diverse molecular signaling conditions. In the context of insulin the model was able to reproduce the variations of senescence level observed in tissues related to main morbidity and mortality. by calibrating the pharmacodynamics of mTOR we have been able to reproduce the dose-dependent effect of rapamycin on liver degeneration and lifespan expansion in wild-type and HER2-neu mice.

Peyraud Cottret Marmiesse Gouzy Genin S. PLoS Pathog. e1005939 Bacterial pathogenicity relies on a proficient metabolism and there is increasing evidence that metabolic adaptation to exploit host resources is a key property of infectious organisms. In many colonization by the pathogen also implies an intensive multiplication and the necessity to produce a large array of virulence which may represent a significant cost for the pathogen. We describe here the existence of a resource allocation trade-off mechanism in the plant pathogen R. solanacearum. We generated a genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network of R. together with a macromolecule network module accounting for the production and secretion of hundreds virulence determinants. By using a combination of constraint-based modeling and metabolic flux we quantified the metabolic cost for production of which are critical for disease symptom and other virulence factors. We demonstrated that this trade-off between virulence factor production and bacterial proliferation is controlled by the quorum-sensing-dependent regulatory protein PhcA. A phcA mutant is avirulent but has a better growth rate than the wild-type strain. a phcA mutant has an expanded metabolic being able to metabolize substrates more than the wild-type. Model predictions indicate that metabolic pathways are optimally oriented towards proliferation in a phcA mutant and we show that this enhanced metabolic versatility in phcA mutants is to a large extent consequence of not paying the cost for virulence. This analysis allowed identifying candidate metabolic substrates having a substantial impact on bacterial growth during infection. the substrates supporting well both production of virulence factors and growth are those found in higher amount within the plant host. These findings also provide an explanatory basis to the well-known emergence of avirulent variants in R. solanacearum populations in planta or stressful environments.

Biotechnological treatment of rice straw hydrolysate has potential to convert this agriculture waste into valuable and platform chemicals. Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius is a thermophile with properties specially suited for use as a biocatalyst in lignocellulosic such as high optimal temperature and tolerance to high levels of ethanol. the capabilities of Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius to utilize sugars in rice straw hydrolysate for making bioethanol and other platform chemicals have not been fully explored. In this we have created a genome scale metabolic model of the organism containing gene reactions and metabolites. The model was validated both by purely theoretical approaches and by comparing the behaviour of model to previously published experimental results. The model was then used to determine the yields of a variety platform chemicals from glucose and xylose two primary sugars in rice straw hydrolysate.

In G2 the arrest is initiated by signalling that blocks mitosis-promoting kinases as Plk1. Plk1 can counteract ATR-dependent signalling and is required for eventual resumption of the cell cycle. what determines when Plk1 activity can resume remains unclear. Here we use FRET-based reporters to show that a global spread of ATM activity on chromatin and phosphorylation of targets including KAP1 control Plk1 re-activation. These phosphorylations are rapidly counteracted by the chromatin-bound phosphatase allowing a cell cycle restart despite persistent ATM activity present at DNA lesions. Combining experimental data and mathematical modelling we propose a model for how the minimal duration of a cell cycle arrest is controlled. Our model shows how cell cycle re-start can occur before completion of DNA repair and suggests a mechanism for checkpoint adaptation in human cells.

This model is described in the Stochastic analysis of the SOS response in Escherichia coli. Shimoni Altuvia Margalit Biham O PloS one. DNA damage in Escherichia coli evokes a response mechanism called the SOS response. The genetic circuit of this mechanism includes the genes recA and which regulate each other via a mixed feedback loop involving transcriptional regulation and protein-protein interaction. Under normal recA is transcriptionally repressed by which also functions as an auto-repressor. In presence of DNA RecA proteins recognize stalled replication forks and participate in the DNA repair process. Under these RecA marks LexA for fast degradation. such mixed feedback loops are known to exhibit either bi-stability or a single steady state. when the dynamics of SOS system following DNA damage was recently studied in single ordered peaks were observed in the promoter activity of both genes et PLoS Biol. This surprising phenomenon was masked in previous studies of cell populations. Previous attempts to explain these results harnessed additional genes to the system and deployed complex deterministic mathematical models that were only partially successful in explaining the results. PRINCIPAL Here we apply stochastic which are better suited for dynamic simulations of single cells. We show that a simple involving only the basic components of the is sufficient to explain the peaks in promoter activities of recA and lexA. deterministic simulations of the same model do not produce peaks in the promoter activities. We conclude that the double negative mixed feedback loop with auto-repression accounts for the experimentally observed peaks in the promoter activities. In addition to explaining the experimental this result shows that including additional regulations in a mixed feedback loop may dramatically change the dynamic functionality of this regulatory module. our results suggests that stochastic fluctuations strongly affect the qualitative behavior of important regulatory modules even under biologically relevant thus emphasizing the importance of stochastic analysis regulatory circuits.

For the common model organism yeast Saccharomyces public databases store a significant part of the accumulated information on the way to better understanding of the cellular there is a need to integrate this information into a consistent reconstruction of the molecular interaction network.

We propose a protein interaction network for the regulation of DNA synthesis and mitosis that emphasizes the universality of regulatory system among eukaryotic cells. The idiosyncrasies of cell cycle regulation in particular organisms can be we to specific settings of rate constants in the dynamic network of chemical reactions. The values of these rate constants are determined ultimately by the genetic makeup of an organism. To support these we convert the reaction mechanism into a set of governing kinetic equations and provide parameter values to budding fission frog and mammalian that account for many curious features of cell cycle regulation in these organisms. Using one-parameter bifurcation we show how overall cell growth drives progression through the cell how cell-size homeostasis can be achieved by two different and how mutations remodel bifurcation diagrams and create unusual cell-division phenotypes. The relation between gene dosage and phenotype can be summarized compactly in two-parameter bifurcation diagrams. Our approach provides a theoretical framework in which to understand both the universality and particularity of cell cycle and to in modular increasingly complex models of the networks controlling cell growth and division.

Yates Stark Klein Antia Callard R. PLoS Med. The asymptomatic phase of HIV infection is characterised by a slow decline of peripheral blood T cells. Why this decline is slow not understood. One potential explanation is that the low average rate of homeostatic proliferation or immune activation dictates the pace of a decline memory T in which activation drives higher viral more recruitment of cells into an activated and further infection events. We explore this hypothesis using mathematical models. METHODS AND Using simple mathematical models of the dynamics T cell homeostasis and we find that this mechanism fails to explain the time scale of memory T cell loss. Instead it predicts the rapid attainment of a stable set so other mechanisms must be invoked to explain the slow decline in cells. A runaway cycle in which elevated T cell activation and proliferation drive HIV production and vice versa cannot explain the pace of depletion during chronic HIV infection. We summarize some alternative mechanisms by which the memory T cell homeostatic set point might slowly diminish.

Beard DA. PLoS Comput Biol. Pubmed A computational model for the mitochondrial respiratory chain that appropriately balances and free energy transduction is introduced and analyzed based on a previously published set of data measured on isolated cardiac mitochondria. The basic components included in the model are reactions at complexes and IV of the electron transport ATP synthesis at F1F0 substrate transporters including adenine nucleotide translocase and the phosphate-hydrogen cation fluxes across the inner membrane including fluxes through the antiporter and passive permeation. Estimation of adjustable parameter values is based on fitting model simulations to nine independent data curves. The identified model is further validated by comparison to additional datasets measured from mitochondria isolated rat heart and liver observed at low oxygen concentration. To obtain reasonable fits to the available it is necessary to incorporate inorganic-phosphate-dependent activation of the dehydrogenase activity and the electron transport system. it is shown that a model incorporating phosphate-dependent activation of complex III is able to reasonably reproduce the observed data. The resulting validated and verified model provides a foundation for building larger and more complex systems models and investigating complex physiological and pathophysiological interactions in cardiac energetics.

A detailed mathematical model of erythrocyte metabolism was presented in the first two papers. The model was refined through an iterative loop of experiment and simulation it was used to predict outcomes that are consistent with the metabolic behaviour of the erythrocyte under a wide variety of experimental and physiological conditions. For the present model was examined using computer simulation and Metabolic Control Analysis. The analysis yielded several new insights into the regulation and control of metabolism. Specifically it was found the feedback inhibition of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase by 3-BPG are equally as important the product inhibition of synthase in controlling the normal in vivo steady-state concentration of and oxygen are effective regulators of concentration and that increases in concentrations are achieved with only small changes in glycolytic these two effectors exert most of their influence through hexokinase and flux through the shunt changes in absolute terms response to different energy demands placed on the cell. This response of the shunt contributes an effect. A of this is that 3-BPG concentrations are very sensitive to the energy demand of the cell flux through the shunt does not change in response to different non-glycolytic demands for NADH.

Koster Destrée OH and Westerhoff HV. J Theor Biol. Nov Using literature data for transcriptional and translational rate gene copy DNA and stability we have calculated the expected concentrations of histones and histone mRNA during embryogenesis of Xenopus laevis. The results led us to conclude for X. laevis the gene copy number of the histone genes is too low to ensure the synthesis of sufficient histones during very early inheritance from the oocyte of either histone protein or mRNA not necessarily is from the known storage of histones in the oocyte and rates of histone synthesis determined by Adamson and Woodland there would be sufficient histones to structure the newly synthesized DNA up to gastrulation but not thereafter empirical rates of histone synthesis may be on the other amount of H3 mRNA recently observed during early embryogenesis Koster et could direct a higher and sufficient synthesis of H3 also after gastrulation. We present a quantitative model that accounts both for the observed H3 mRNA concentration as a function of time during embryogenesis and for the synthesis of sufficient histones to structure the DNA throughout early embryogenesis. The model suggests that X. laevis exhibits a major some reduction in transcription of histone genes approximately hours after fertilization. This reduction could be due to a decrease in the number of transcribed histone a decreased rate constant of transcription with continued of all the histone a reduction in the time during cell cycle in which histone mRNA synthesis takes place. the histone mRNA stability might decrease approximately 16-fold hours after fertilization.

Nijhout Reed Budu Ulrich CM J. Biol. Reference A mathematical model is developed for the folate cycle based on standard biochemical kinetics. We use the model to provide new insights into several different mechanisms of folate homeostasis. The model reproduces the known pool sizes of folate substrates and the fluxes through each of the loops folate cycle and has the qualitative behavior observed in a variety of experimental studies. Vitamin modeled as a reduction in the of methionine synthase results in a secondary folate deficiency via the accumulation of folate as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate One form of homeostasis is revealed by the fact that a 100-fold up-regulation of thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase to occur at the dramatically increases pyrimidine production without affecting the other reactions of the folate cycle. The model also predicts that an almost total inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase is required to significantly inhibit the thymidylate synthase consistent with experimental and clinical studies on the effects of methotrexate. Sensitivity to variation in enzymatic parameters tends to be local in the cycle and inversely proportional to the number of reactions that interconvert two folate substrates. Another form of homeostasis is a consequence of the nonenzymatic binding of folate substrates to enzymes. Without folate the velocities of reactions decrease approximately linearly as total folate is decreased. In the presence of folate binding and allosteric the velocities show a remarkable constancy as total folate is decreased.

There is a particular opportunity to apply systems level tools developed for the model bacterium Escherichia coli to study the evolution and function of symbiotic bacteria which are metabolically specialised to overproduce specific nutrients for their host have a gene complement that is asubset ofthe E. coli genome. We have reconstructed and analysed the metabolic network of the gamma-proteobacterium Buchnera aphidicola of the pea as a model for using systems-level approaches to discover key traits of symbionts with small genomes. The metabolic network is extremely fragile with of thereactions essential for viability in and it is structured so that the bacterium cannot grow without producing the essential amino which is released to the insect host. amount of essential amino acid produced by the bacterium in silico can be controlledby host supply of carbon and nitrogen substrates. This systems-level analysis predicts that the fragility of bacterial metabolic network renders the symbiotic bacterium intolerant of drastic environmental while the coupling of histidine production to growth prevents the bacterium from exploiting host nutrients without reciprocating. These metabolic traits underpin the sustained nutritional contribution of B. aphidicola to the host together with the impact of host-derived substrates on the profile of nutrients released from the point to a dominant role of the host in controlling the symbiosis. Systems level analysis of other taxa will establish the generality of these traits among symbiotic bacteria with reduced genomes.

This computational approach allows us to investigate discrepancies in our understanding of the interaction MMP9 with TIMP1. we find that inhibition due to a single binding event cannot describe MMP9 inhibition by TIMP1. Temporally accurate biphasic inhibition requires either an additional isomerization step or a second lower affinity isoform of MMP9. We also theoretically characterize the and systems. We speculate that these systems differ significantly in their time scales of activation and inhibition such that MMP9 is able to temporarily overshoot its final equilibrium value in the latter.

I. Bursting pacemaker neurons. Butera RJ Rinzel Smith JC. J Neurophysiol. Pubmed full text at the Journal of Neurophysiology A network of oscillatory bursting neurons with excitatory coupling is hypothesized to define the primary kernel for respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex in mammals. Two minimal models of these neurons are proposed. In model bursting arises via fast activation and slow inactivation of a persistent current INaP-h. In model bursting arises via a fast-activating persistent current INaP and slow activation of a current IKS. In both action potentials are generated via fast and currents. The two models have few differences in parameters to facilitate a rigorous comparison of the two different burst-generating mechanisms. Both models are consistent with many of the dynamic features of electrophysiological recordings from pre-BötC oscillatory bursting neurons in including voltage-dependent activity modes and a voltage-dependent burst frequency that can vary from to and a decaying spike frequency during bursting. These results are robust and persist across a wide range of parameter values for both models. the dynamics of model are more consistent with experimental data in that the burst duration decreases as the baseline membrane potential is depolarized and the model has a relatively flat membrane potential trajectory during the interburst interval. We propose several experimental tests to demonstrate the validity of either model and to differentiate between the two mechanisms.

The model incorporates the kinetics of prolactin-receptor interactions and subsequent signalling by prolactin-receptor dimers to regulate the production of receptor mRNA and hence the receptor population. The model relates changes in plasma prolactin concentration to receptor gene and can be used for predictive purposes.

Schneider Shimayoshi Amano Matsuda T. J Mol Cell Cardiol. A stretch-induced increase of active tension is one of the most important properties of the known as Frank-Starling law. Although a variation of myofilament sensitivity with sarcomere length change was found to be the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully clarified. Some recent experimental studies indicate that a reduction of the lattice spacing between thin and thick through the increase of passive tension caused by the sarcomeric protein titin with an increase in SL within the physiological promotes formation of force-generating crossbridges the mechanism by which the Xb concentration determines the degree of cooperativity for a given SL has so far evaded experimental elucidation. In this simulation a rather simple molecular-based cardiac contraction appropriate for integration into a ventricular cell was being the first model to introduce experimental data on titin-based radial tension to account for the SL-dependent modulation of the interfilament lattice spacing and to include a conformational change of troponin I Simulation results for the isometric twitch contraction time the length-tension and relationships are comparable to experimental data. A complete potential Frank-Starling mechanism was analyzed by this simulation study. The SL-dependent modulation of the myosin binding rate through passive tension determines the Xb concentration which then alters the degree of positive cooperativity affecting the rate of TnI conformation change and causing the Hill coefficient to be SL-dependent.

Razumova Bukatina Campbell KB. Biophys J. Cooperativity in contractile behavior of myofilament systems almost assuredly arises because of interactions between neighboring sites. These interactions may be of different kinds. Tropomyosin thin-filament regulatory units may have neighbors in steric blocking positions or steric permissive positions The position of these neighbors influence the tendency for regulatory unit to assume the on or off state. the tendency of a myosin cross-bridge to achieve a force-bearing state may be influenced by whether neighboring cross-bridges are in force-bearing states. a cross-bridge in the force-bearing state may influence the tendency of a regulatory unit to enter the on state. We used a mathematical model to examine the influence of each these three kinds of neighbor interactions on the steady-state force-pCa relation and on the dynamic force redevelopment process. Each neighbor interaction was unique in its effects on maximal and symmetry of the force-pCa curve and on the Hill coefficient. each neighbor interaction had a distinctive effect on the time course of force development as assessed by its rate These diverse effects suggest that variations in all three kinds of nearest-neighbor interactions may be responsible for a wide variety of currently unexplained observations of myofilament contractile behavior.

According to one the chaotic excitation dynamics during VF are the result of dynamical instabilities in action potential duration the occurrence of which requires that the slope of APD restitution curve exceeds Other factors such as electrotonic coupling and cardiac memory also determine whether these instabilities can develop. In this paper we study the conditions for alternans and spiral breakup in human cardiac tissue. we develop a new version of our human ventricular cell which is based on recent experimental measurements of human APD restitution and includes a more extensive description of intracellular calcium dynamics. We apply this model to study the conditions for electrical instability in single for reentrant waves in a ring of and for reentry in two-dimensional sheets of ventricular tissue. We show that an important determinant for the onset of instability is the recovery dynamics of the fast sodium current. Slower current recovery leads to longer periods of spiral wave rotation and more gradual conduction velocity both of which suppress restitution-mediated instability. As a maximum restitution slopes considerably exceeding to may be necessary for electrical instability to occur. Although slopes necessary for the onset of instabilities found in our study exceed they are within the range of experimentally measured slopes. we conclude that steep APD restitution-mediated instability is a potential mechanism for VF in the human heart.

Ann Biomed Eng. year volume page Experimental studies have shown that cardiac fibroblasts are electrically but can contribute to electrophysiology of myocardium in various manners. The aim of this computational study was to give insights in the electrophysiological role of fibroblasts and their interaction with myocytes. We developed a mathematical model of fibroblasts based on data from whole-cell patch clamp and polymerase chain reaction studies. The fibroblast model was applied together with models of ventricular myocytes to assess effects of heterogeneous intercellular electrical coupling. We investigated the modulation of action potentials a single myocyte varying the number of coupled fibroblasts and intercellular resistance. Coupling to fibroblasts had only a minor impact on the resting and peak transmembrane but led to significant changes of action potential duration and upstroke velocity. We examined the impact of fibroblasts on conduction in one-dimensional strands of myocytes. Coupled fibroblasts reduced conduction and upstroke velocity. We studied electrical bridging between ventricular myocytes via fibroblast insets for various coupling resistors. The simulations showed significant conduction delays up to ms. In the simulations support strongly the hypothesis that coupling of fibroblasts to myocytes modulates electrophysiology of cardiac cells and tissues.

You Coghill Brown AJ. Yeast. Mar epub ahead of Messenger RNA translation is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression that contributes to the regulation of this process. We describe a deterministic model based on ordinary differential equations that describe mRNA translation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This which was parameterized using published was developed to examine the kinetic behaviour of translation initiation factors in response to amino acid availability. The model predicts that the abundance of eIF1-eIF3-eIF5 complex increases under amino acid starvation suggesting a possible auxiliary role for these factors in modulating translation initiation in addition to the known mechanisms involving eIF2. Our analyses of the robustness mRNA translation model suggest that individual cells within a randomly generated population are sensitive to external perturbations as changes in amino acid through Gcn2 signalling. the model predicts that individual cells exhibit robustness against internal perturbations as changes in the abundance of translation initiation factors and kinetic Gcn2 appears to enhance this robustness within the system. These findings suggest a trade-off between the robustness and performance of this biological network. The model also predicts that individual cells exhibit considerable heterogeneity with respect to their absolute translation due to random internal perturbations. averaging the kinetic behaviour of cell populations probably obscures the dynamic robustness of individual cells. This highlights the importance of single-cell measurements for evaluating network properties. Copyright John Wiley and Ltd.

It is highly recommended that those wanting to model this system use the MatLab version which we will freely provide upon request. As simulation results vary according to the numerical solver used. In there are also shortcomings in the Stimulation Phase of the model that maybe resolved with future versions of SBML. SBML Generation Translation to SBML Level was performed via reconstruction of the model within MathWorks SimBiology Desktop followed by an Export to SBML.

Use these to validate whether your simulation time is long enough and whether your solver is behaving properly. Stimulation Phase.- The simulations of this phase have known shortcomings due to insufficient support by the SBML framework. These include not being able to utilize an interpolation function and lack of delay functions in SBML but not yet in the MathWorks SimBiology Resolution of these should enable recapitulation of the Stimulation Phase results shown in the Cell paper.- The model input signal is defined as activity profiles for IKK1 and IKK2 via biochemical Profiles are included below for Lympotoxin-Beta activation of IKK1 and for Tumor Necrosis Factor and Lipopolysaccharide activation of IKK2.

Circ Res. Patients with severe heart failure are at high risk of sudden cardiac death. In the majority of these sudden cardiac death is thought to be due ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Alterations of the electric properties of single myocytes in heart failure may favor the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in these patients by inducing early or delayed afterdepolarizations. Mathematical models of the cellular action potential and its underlying ionic currents could help to elucidate possible arrhythmogenic mechanisms on a cellular level. In the present selected ionic currents based on human data are incorporated into a model of the ventricular action potential for the purpose of studying the cellular electrophysiological consequences of heart failure. Ionic currents that are not yet sufficiently characterized in human ventricular myocytes are adopted from the action potential model developed by Luo and Rudy The main results obtained from this model are as The action potential in ventricular myocytes from failing hearts is longer than in nonfailing control hearts. The major underlying mechanisms for this prolongation are the enhanced activity of the slowed diastolic decay of the and reduction of the inwardly rectifying current and the pump current in myocytes of failing hearts. the fast and slow components of the delayed rectifier current and are of utmost importance in determining repolarization of the human ventricular action potential. In the influence of transient outward current on APD is only small in both cell groups. Inhibition of promotes the development of early afterdepolarizations in but not myocytes. spontaneous release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum triggers a premature action potential only in failing myocytes. This model of the ventricular action potential and its alterations in heart failure is intended to serve as a tool for investigating the effects of therapeutic interventions on the electric excitability of the human ventricular myocardium.

Potter Zager Barton HA. Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab. The testicular-hypothalamic-pituitary axis regulates male reproductive system functions. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is important for assessing the reproductive effects of environmental and pharmaceutical androgenic antiandrogenic compounds. A mathematical model for the dynamics of androgenic and regulation of the adult rodent ventral prostate was developed on the basis of a model by Barton and Anderson The model describes the systemic and local kinetics of testosterone 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone and luteinizing hormone with metabolism of T to DHT by 5alpha-reductase in liver and prostate. Also included are feedback loops for the positive regulation of T synthesis by LH and negative regulation of LH by T and DHT. The model simulates maintenance of the prostate as a function of hormone concentrations and androgen receptor signal transduction. The regulatory processes involved in prostate size and function include cell fluid and 5alpha-reductase activity. Each process is controlled through the occupancy of a representative gene by androgen-AR dimers. The model simulates prostate dynamics for and intravenous T-injected rats. After the model accurately captures the castration-induced regression of the prostate compared with experimental data that show the prostate regresses to approximately and of its intact weight at and days respectively. The model also accurately predicts serum T and AR levels following castration compared with data.

Pandit Giles Demir SS. Biophys J. Pt Our mathematical model of the rat ventricular myocyte et was utilized to explore the ionic that underlie the altered electrophysiological characteristics associated with the short-term model of type-I diabetes. The simulations show that the observed reductions in the transient outward current and the steady-state outward current along with slowed inactivation of the L-type current can result in the prolongation of action potential a well-known experimental finding. In the model demonstrates that the slowed reactivation kinetics of in diabetic myocytes can account for the more pronounced rate-dependent action potential duration prolongation in and that a decrease in the electrogenic pump current results in a small depolarization in the resting membrane potential This depolarization reduces the availability of channels thereby resulting in a slower upstroke of the diabetic action potential. Additional simulations suggest that a reduction in the magnitude of in combination with impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake can lead to a decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum load. These factors contribute to characteristic abnormal homeostasis peak systolic value and rate of in myocytes from diabetic animals. In these simulation results provide novel information and integrative insights concerning plausible ionic mechanisms for the observed changes in cardiac repolarization and excitation-contraction coupling in rat ventricular myocytes in the setting of type-I diabetes.

The individual components of ionic curent were described by equations which wee based as closely possible on previous experiments using the voltage clamp technique. Membrane action potentials and pace-maker activity were calculated and compared with time course of underlying changes in two functionally distinct outeard iX1 and iK2. The repolarization of the theoretical action potential is triggered by the onset of which becomes activated over the plateau range of potentials. iK2 also activates during the plateau but does not play a controlling role in the repolarization. iK2 does govern the slow pace-maker depolarization through its subsequent deactivation at negative potentials. The individual phases of the calculated action potential and their modifications were compared with published records.

Maleckar Greenstein Trayanova Giles WR. Prog Biophys Mol Biol. In the mammalian myocytes and fibroblasts can communicate via gap or connexin-mediated current flow. Some of the effects this electroto nic coupling on the action potential waveform of the human ventricular myocyte have been analyzed in detail. The present study employs a recently developed mathematical model of the human atrial myocyte to investigate the consequences of this heterogeneous cell-cell interaction on the action potential of the human atrium. Two independent physiological processes which alter the physiology of human atrium have been studied. The effects of the autonomic tra nsmitter acetylcholine on the atrial action potential have been investigated by inclusion of a acetylcholine-activated current in th is mathematical model of the atrial myocyte. A non-selective cation current which is activated by natriuretic peptides has been incorporated into a pre viously published mathematical model of the cardiac fibroblast. These results identify subtle effects of which arise from the nonlinear inte ractions between ionic currents in the human atrial myocyte. They also illustrate marked alterations in the action potential waveform arising from fibrobla st-myocyte source-sink principles when the natriuretic peptide-mediated cation conductance is activated. Additional calculations also illustrate the effect s of simultaneous activation both of these cell-type specific conductances within the atrial myocardium.

MacGregor Leng G. J Neuroendocrinol we construct a mathematical model of the hypothalamic systems that control the secretion of growth hormone The work extends a recent model of the pituitary GH adding representations of the hypothalamic GH-releasing hormone and somatostatin each modelled as a single synchronised unit. An unpatterned stochastic input drives the GHRH neurones generating pulses of GHRH release that trigger GH pulses. Delayed feedback from GH results in increased somatostatin which inhibits both GH secretion and GHRH producing an overall pattern of 3-h pulses GH secretion that is very similar to the secretory profile observed in male rats. Rather than directly stimulating somatostatin GH feedback triggers a priming increasing releasable stores of somatostatin. Varying this priming effect to reduce the effect of GH can reproduce the less pulsatile form of GH release observed in the female rat. The model behaviour is tested by comparison with experimental observations a range of different experimental protocols involving GHRH injections and somatostatin GH infusion.
